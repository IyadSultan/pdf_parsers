**Abstract:** The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.

<chunk>
The Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups.  These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Extensive communication occurred with colleagues from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) to ensure the use of all relevant evidence, particularly the results of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which studied the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating intermediate-risk stage II-III Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, there have been extensive discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG on global strategies for children with renal tumors, resulting in a shared body of knowledge that informed the current UMBRELLA diagnostic and treatment guideline.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Treatment of Wilms tumors is tailored to the individual patient based on tumor stage and histology, employing a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced, increasing survival rates to approximately 90%.  The identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors is crucial for improving patient stratification based on risk.  Currently, about two-thirds of Wilms tumor patients receive chemotherapy using only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine. Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from the addition of doxorubicin.  Surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques are continually improving.  For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommends preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients diagnosed with Wilms tumor at or above 26 months of age, a recommendation supported by previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).  These studies showed that this regimen effectively downstages tumors.  In patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or doxorubicin can be reduced by 20% compared to direct nephrectomy without impacting survival.  The SIOP-RTSG recommends direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children under 6 months of age or those with atypical clinical presentations or imaging findings, aiming to avoid treatment delays.  Routine histological assessment before treatment isn't advocated, as it's been shown to be safe and effectively identifies patients with non-Wilms tumors who might otherwise receive unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Preoperative chemotherapy allows for personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity and aids in identifying high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors.  The centralized histology review process within the SIOP-RTSG has demonstrated the feasibility and clinical relevance of identifying the blastemal subtype.  However, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be enhanced by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema instead of the relative percentage, a factor which will be further investigated within the UMBRELLA protocol.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo signifies the aim to collect information concerning all pediatric primary renal tumors in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry.  This includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The registry covers clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK), congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients registered in the UMBRELLA protocol will continue to be stratified for postoperative treatment according to tumor stage and histological risk group, as in the SIOP-2001 protocol. Prospective data from stratified and treated patients will be collected and analyzed. This data, combined with integrated biomarker and imaging studies (assessing the contribution of 1q gain and residual blastemal volume), may guide future stratification.  The experimental arm’s therapeutic regimen from the SIOP-2001 trial has been adopted as the standard management for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol. This regimen involves 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin.
</chunk>

<chunk>
This schedule showed a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm in the SIOP-2001 trial (27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m²). Post-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data examined the association between omitting doxorubicin and outcomes in patients with large-volume tumors (>500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumor types were excluded, leaving only stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors.  Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 5-year EFS of 80% for large-volume tumors versus 90% for small-volume tumors (log rank P=0.01).  Importantly, EFS improved significantly (93% versus 67%, log rank P=0.0005) when doxorubicin was added to the treatment regimen for large-volume tumors. Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  The UMBRELLA protocol will continue treatment for blastemal-type tumors according to the SIOP-2001 regimen. A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trial results showed that intensifying treatment in SIOP-2001 (for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors) increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006), avoiding intensive relapse treatment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Approximately 17% of patients with Wilms tumors present with stage IV disease at diagnosis. This is defined as hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites; or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are most common. Increased use of chest CT for staging has led to the detection of small pulmonary nodules.

CT-only nodules, not visible on chest radiography, are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm.  Presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or secondary malignancies.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Similar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61-67% of patients have complete metastatic response before surgery. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered in order to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m² in SIOP-2001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² for patients with favourable histology does not considerably affect survival.  For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m², vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of 250 mg/m², or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150 mg/m²/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m²/day), cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m²/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m²). Stratification is based on local stage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary tumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Notably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centres discuss the best current treatment approach with the principle investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.

Bilateral disease (stage V). Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour (stage V) accounts for ~5–8% of instances of Wilms tumour and long-term overall survival is currently ~80%. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson *et al*. observed that functional renal outcome was considerably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes associated with *WT1* mutations, are at increased risk of ESRD<sup>1</sup>. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol. However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies. The occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.

<chunk>
Relapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used<sup>2,3</sup>. Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors. Treatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I–II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours, who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW-R protocol and the NWTS-5 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied<sup>4,5</sup>. Patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan

Table 2 provides a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms tumor (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is organized by metastasis surgery, Wilms tumor histology, and treatment.  For patients with complete remission or very good partial remission, treatment varies depending on the risk level (low or intermediate) and the presence and size of lung nodules.  Surgical resection is recommended if feasible, followed by adjuvant therapy (AVD150 or AVD250) and sometimes pulmonary radiotherapy.

For patients with partial response or stable disease, treatment choices also depend on the risk level and whether viable metastasis is confirmed.  If a representative nodule resection is feasible, AVD250 with radiotherapy is considered. CT scans are used at week 10 to assess response and guide further treatment. Resection might be recommended if remaining nodules persist.  For cases where resection isn't feasible, treatment plans again vary based on risk level and the presence of viable or necrotic metastasis, involving regimens like AVD250 or four-drug regimens with radiotherapy and CT scans at week 10 for assessment.

In cases of progressive disease and a representative nodule that's resectable, treatment relies on a four-drug regimen with radiotherapy and CT scans for monitoring.  If the nodule is not resectable, the same four-drug regimen with radiotherapy is used.  For all patients with high-risk disease, consultation with the principal investigator is crucial, and treatment involves radiotherapy.  If metastatic disease is confirmed by histology, treatment is determined by the worst histology and response.  The table notes the source as the UMBRELLA-SIOP-RTSG-2016 protocol, defining the abbreviations AVD and CDCV, which represent specific chemotherapy drug combinations.

The text following the table discusses the use of autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) and reinduction courses in the treatment of Wilms tumor. Acceptable response rates have been observed with various chemotherapy combinations, including cyclophosphamide and etoposide, and carboplatin and etoposide. However, ifosfamide has shown a higher response rate but with increased risk of nephrotoxicity.  To mitigate this risk, cyclophosphamide is alternated with ifosfamide in the proposed protocol.  Given the heterogeneous settings and inconclusive results from previous studies involving high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR, the authors advocate for a flexible approach to the consolidation phase, leaving the decision of using high-dose chemotherapy to the discretion of the treating physician.  The plan is to track and report these findings in a prospective observational study.

A separate section focuses on relapsed patients, categorized into group CC, which includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol suggests the use of camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or other novel compounds.  This strategy is warranted because these patients have already undergone conventional treatments and are likely to present with chemotherapy-resistant disease.  The SIOP-RTSG is actively involved in supporting initiatives for new drug development focused on children with cancer.

Finally, the text highlights the limited exploration of localized treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical excision for relapsing tumors.  This signifies a gap in the current research and suggests a potential area for further investigation.

The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery administration at relapse.  These guidelines include considering resection after proven disease reduction following chemotherapy, irrespective of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery is feasible or when evaluating histological tumor response is beneficial.  Radiotherapy application to initially unirradiated sites is widely accepted; however, establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites is challenging due to diverse situations.  The UMBRELLA protocol suggests consulting radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel for such cases.

Infant Wilms tumors (patients under 6 months) are generally considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol, unless immediate nephrectomy is deemed unsuitable by a multidisciplinary team.  Upfront nephrectomy is prioritized for infants because a higher proportion of their renal tumors are congenital mesoblastic nephromas or malignant rhabdoid tumors requiring either surgery alone or intensive chemotherapy.  Percutaneous needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants mirrors that of older children who underwent direct nephrectomy, with dose adjustments based on age and weight, reflecting previous SIOP studies.

</chunk>
<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol provides comprehensive guidelines for managing adult Wilms tumors, acknowledging the often prolonged treatment delays and resulting poor outcomes.  Adult Wilms tumor diagnosis is uncommon and treatment recommendations are based on literature reviews and international consensus, as documented in 2011.  Diagnosis often occurs unexpectedly after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is advised when Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery. Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk in adults, as no evidence suggests that focal anaplasia results in better outcomes.  Adult patients frequently experience significant delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time needed for histological verification.  Therefore, pediatric treatment protocols cannot be directly applied to adults.  For instance, the actinomycin D and vincristine regimen for pediatric stage I disease is only recommended for select adult stage I patients without anaplasia.  Other adult patients require more intensive treatment, including vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (nonanaplastic subtypes) or a four-drug regimen (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors.  Exceptions might be made for favorable histology stage II tumors with timely diagnosis, allowing chemotherapy to begin within 14 days post-surgery.  Vincristine dosage is lower for adults due to the higher frequency of severe neurological toxicities.

</chunk>
<chunk>
For children with Wilms tumor, the standard treatment after preoperative chemotherapy is radical tumor nephrectomy. The UMBRELLA protocol provides surgical guidelines emphasizing the importance of lymph node sampling (aiming for seven locoregional nodes) for accurate staging.  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors meeting specific criteria outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol: small tumor volume (&lt;300ml) and anticipation of significant remaining kidney function in patients with tumors &lt;300ml and no lymph node involvement.  A new NSS classification system, developed collaboratively by surgeons and pathologists from SIOP-RTSG, has been adopted within the UMBRELLA protocol to optimize outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess NSS feasibility and minimize the risk of upstaging due to incomplete tumor resection.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.

Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.

## Consensus Statement: International Collaboration in Wilms Tumour Treatment

The UMBRELLA protocol represents a significant advancement in the treatment of Wilms tumour, a pediatric kidney cancer.  This protocol will guide treatment in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond, establishing the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumour protocol to date.  This international collaboration facilitates large-scale research, crucial for understanding and improving treatment outcomes.  In Europe alone, approximately 1000 cases of pediatric renal tumours are diagnosed annually. While survival rates are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG (SIOP Renal Tumour Study Group) aims to address geographical disparities in childhood cancer survival by implementing a standardized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  This standardized approach is particularly important for the approximately 300 cases of complex renal tumours in Europe annually, which necessitate multidisciplinary discussions and specialized expertise for optimal treatment.


Examples of cases that benefit from such specialized care include instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, those with extensive intravascular tumour thrombus or complex metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumours.  International collaboration is vital in these complex cases to provide access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and participation in phase I/II trials.


European initiatives such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-r-Net) are actively promoting this collaboration. ExPO-r-Net, an online consultation platform, aims to connect national reference centres, facilitating the establishment of international tumour boards, securing funding for coordinators, providing IT support and logistics, and extending outreach to low-income countries.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The UMBRELLA protocol serves a dual purpose: providing a practical guideline for routine clinical practice and stimulating international collaboration and research.  By standardizing the treatment approach across all Wilms tumour types, the protocol enables the collection of large, homogenous datasets from a substantial patient cohort. This standardized data collection will be invaluable for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.  Moreover, the UMBRELLA protocol establishes itself as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard, forming the basis for future treatment approaches in phase I/II trials and randomized controlled trials.  Continued collaboration with the COG (Children's Oncology Group) is crucial for advancing this research.  The global nature of the UMBRELLA protocol underscores the ongoing need for international collaboration to address the challenges posed by the most unfavourable forms of Wilms tumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease.  The protocol's impact will be significant in improving outcomes for these challenging cases.
