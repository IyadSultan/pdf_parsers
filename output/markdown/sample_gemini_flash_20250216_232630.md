**Abstract:** The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.

This Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol offers treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups. These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the incorporation of all relevant evidence, particularly from the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating intermediate-risk stage II-III Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, extensive discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops have refined recommendations and shaped global strategies for children with renal tumors.  The sharing of data and knowledge from these collaborations directly influenced the design of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnosis and treatment.

<chunk>
Treatment for Wilms tumors is tailored to individual patients, considering tumor stage and histology.  Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has decreased significantly, resulting in a 90% survival rate.  However, identifying additional predictive and prognostic factors remains crucial to improve patient stratification based on individual risk. Currently, approximately two-thirds of patients receive chemotherapy with only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from the addition of doxorubicin.  Surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are continuously improving with the advancement of innovative techniques.  For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol mirrors the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommending preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients over 6 months old, a practice supported by previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).  This approach, shown to effectively downstage tumors, reduces the need for radiotherapy or doxorubicin in patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, with no significant impact on survival.  The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosing Wilms tumors, recommending direct surgery for children under 6 months or fine-needle biopsy for those with atypical clinical presentations or imaging findings.  Routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated to avoid delays. This strategy successfully identifies most non-Wilms tumors, preventing unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Preoperative chemotherapy allows for a personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity, particularly in identifying high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The centralized histology review process within the SIOP-RTSG has demonstrated the feasibility and clinical relevance of identifying this subtype.  However, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be enhanced by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, a factor that will be further investigated within the UMBRELLA protocol.

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo signifies a comprehensive effort to collect information on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, mirroring the SIOP-2001 protocol.  Data will be collected and analyzed, incorporating biomarker and imaging studies to potentially refine future stratification. The experimental arm's therapeutic regimen from the SIOP-2001 trial—27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin—has been adopted as the standard for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This regimen, while showing a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm in SIOP-2001, had no effect on overall survival.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Post-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data examined the impact of omitting doxorubicin on patients with large-volume tumors (>500ml after preoperative chemotherapy).  Stromal and epithelial tumors were excluded, focusing on stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors.  The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in 5-year EFS between large-volume (80%) and small-volume (90%) tumors (log-rank P=0.01). Critically, adding doxorubicin to the treatment regimen for large-volume tumors significantly improved EFS (93% vs 67%, log-rank P=0.0005). Consequently, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  Treatment for blastemal-type tumors will continue to follow the SIOP-2001 regimen. A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials highlighted that intensifying treatment for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log-rank P=0.006), while significantly reducing the need for relapse treatment.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Approximately 17% of Wilms tumor patients present with stage IV metastatic disease at diagnosis. This is defined as hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most common. Increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of smaller pulmonary nodules.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT

**Figure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial. Association of tumour volume with (a) event-free survival (EFS) and (b) overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier curves.**

(a) shows a Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating the association between tumor volume and event-free survival (EFS).  The 60-month EFS for tumors <500ml is 90.3% (95% CI: 87.1-93.5), while for tumors ≥500ml it is 80.0% (95% CI: 70.5-90.8). The hazard ratio (HR) is 2.38 (95% CI: 1.26-4.51), with a log-rank P-value of 0.01.

(b) shows a Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating the association between tumor volume and overall survival (OS). The 60-month OS for tumors <500ml is 96.7% (95% CI: 94.6-98.8), while for tumors ≥500ml it is 93.1% (95% CI: 86.8-99.9). The hazard ratio (HR) is 2.51 (95% CI: 0.87-7.24), with a log-rank P-value of 0.08.  Both graphs include tables showing the number of patients at each time point for both tumor volume categories.

CT-only nodules, not visible on chest radiography, are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in both the COG and UMBRELLA protocols if their transverse diameter is at least 3 mm.  The presence of these CT-only nodules is associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival.  Studies have shown that patients with CT-only nodules treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS compared to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, although overall survival was similar between the groups.  Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease benefits patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response.  These patients don't require pulmonary radiotherapy, reducing the risk of long-term sequelae.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Similar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local and metastatic sites before surgery. With this regimen, 61-67% of patients have a complete metastatic response before surgery.  Detailed guidelines are provided for postoperative chemotherapy stratification, with the cumulative doxorubicin dose lowered to reduce cardiac toxicity.  In SIOP-2001, the cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m².  Preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggests that a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² for patients with favorable histology doesn't significantly affect survival. Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to one of three regimens: vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (150 mg/m² cumulative dose), vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (250 mg/m² cumulative dose), or a four-drug regimen (etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin).  Stratification is based on the local stage of the primary tumor, histology of the primary and metastatic tumors, size of metastatic lesions, and response to preoperative treatment and surgery.

Patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination represent a rare subgroup with a poor prognosis.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centers discuss the best treatment approach with the principal investigator for stage IV disease.  The SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen (based on unpublished data) including vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is debated, but favorable outcomes have been reported. Details of this regimen are in the UMBRELLA protocol's appendix. Data on its use and outcomes will be captured in the SIOP database for future evaluation.

Bilateral disease (stage V). Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour (stage V) accounts for ~5–8% of instances of Wilms tumour and long-term overall survival is currently ~80%. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et al. observed that functional renal outcome was considerably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of ESRD. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol. However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies. The occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.

Relapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used<sup>1–3</sup>. Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors. Treatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I–II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours, who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW-R protocol and the NWTS-5 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied<sup>4,5</sup>. Patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan

Autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) or two further reinduction courses, at the discretion of the local physician, are considered. Acceptable response rates have been observed with both cyclophosphamide and etoposide and carboplatin and etoposide combinations, but ifosfamide showed an increased response rate in early-phase trials.  To reduce the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide. The heterogeneous settings in which the role of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR has been explored and the inconclusive results reported led to a proposed flexible approach to the consolidation phase, with high-dose chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician.  The aim is to describe the results in a prospective observational fashion.

Relapsed group CC includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For patients in this category, and for other relapsing patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol advises trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, as these patients will have already received most conventional active agents in their first-line therapy and are likely to develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. The SIOP-RTSG commits to endorse initiatives dedicated to new drug development in children, such as those launched by the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.

Importantly, approaches to local treatment (including radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses) have not been systematically explored.

</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at relapse.  These guidelines include considering resection after proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemotherapy, irrespective of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery seems possible or when evaluating histological tumor response is useful. Applying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites is uniformly accepted, but developing standard recommendations for the approach to previously irradiated sites is challenging due to the variability of situations encountered.  For these instances, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends contacting radiotherapists on the SIOP-RTSG panel.

Infants (younger than 6 months or 182 days) should be considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol unless tumors are deemed inoperable by a multidisciplinary team.  Upfront nephrectomy is preferred for infants because a higher proportion of renal tumors in this age group are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, which either require surgery alone or alternative chemotherapy. Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants is similar to that in older children, adjusting drug doses according to age and body weight based on previous SIOP studies.

Adult Wilms tumors are managed according to comprehensive UMBRELLA guidelines, acknowledging the long treatment delays and associated poor outcomes.  Diagnosis in adults is exceptional, and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and multidisciplinary consensus. Adult Wilms tumor is often unexpectedly diagnosed after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if the diagnosis of Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as there is no evidence suggesting that patients with focal anaplasia have better outcomes. Adults often experience significant delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time needed for histological verification.  Therefore, pediatric treatment regimens cannot be directly applied to adults.  For example, the pediatric stage I regimen of actinomycin D and vincristine is only recommended for a select group of adult stage I patients without anaplasia.  Other adults receive more intensive treatment, varying based on the presence or absence of anaplasia.</chunk>

<chunk>
After preoperative chemotherapy, radical nephrectomy is the standard of care for children with Wilms tumor. The UMBRELLA protocol emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, aiming to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for accurate staging.  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors under specific conditions outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol, including small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of substantial remnant kidney function in patients with tumors <300 ml and no lymph node involvement.  A new classification system for NSS, developed by SIOP-RTSG surgeons and pathologists, optimizes outcome comparison within the UMBRELLA protocol.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging from incomplete resection.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (TABLE 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%)<sup>1</sup>. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs<sup>2</sup>. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology<sup>3</sup>.

Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed<sup>4</sup>. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol<sup>5</sup>.

The UMBRELLA protocol will guide the treatment of Wilms tumors in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond.  This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumor protocol published to date, facilitating significant international research. In Europe alone, approximately 1000 pediatric renal tumors are diagnosed annually. While overall survival rates are excellent, the SIOP-RTSG aims to address geographical disparities in childhood cancer survival by implementing standardized approaches to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  Estimates suggest that around 300 cases of complex renal tumors in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussions with experts at specialized centers. These cases include most instances of bilateral Wilms tumors, patients with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complex metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors.  International collaboration will be crucial for these patients, providing access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials.

European initiatives, such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net) aim to enhance this collaboration.  The ExPO-R-Net is an online platform connecting national reference centers (Figure 4), contributing to the establishment of international tumor boards, securing funding for coordinators and IT infrastructure, and facilitating future outreach to lower-income countries.  The preliminary European surgical expert referral sites include: University Hospital of Munich, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Azienda Ospedaliera, Padova, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Prinses Maxima Centrum, Utrecht, Marciniak Hospital, Wroclaw, Faculty of Medicine, Gdansk, St. Anna Kinderspital/CCRI, Vienna, Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paris, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. The overall subnetwork coordination centers include: University Hospital Homburg, Princes Maxima Centrum, Utrecht, L'Institut d'Hématologie et d'Oncologie Pédiatrique de Lyon, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.

The UMBRELLA protocol serves a dual purpose: it provides a valuable guideline for routine clinical practice and stimulates international collaboration and research. By standardizing treatment for all Wilms tumor types, it allows for the prospective collection of data from a large, homogenous patient cohort. This data will be invaluable for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and the identification of therapeutic targets.  The UMBRELLA protocol will serve as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard, forming the foundation for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials. Ongoing collaboration with the COG will be essential.  However, global collaboration remains crucial for finding effective treatments for the most challenging cases of Wilms tumors, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease.  The UMBRELLA protocol aims to significantly contribute to progress in these areas.
