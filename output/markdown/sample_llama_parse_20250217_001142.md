                                                   (SIOP–RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal
                                                   tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP–RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international
                                                   collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated
                                                   biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of
                                                   genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives
                                                   preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol
                                                   include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and
                                                   for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel
                                                   of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP–RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should
                                                   promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP–RTSG best available
                                                   treatment standard.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in iden-
tified reference centres. Issues related to minimally
invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the
UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated,
owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these
techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances,
including small, central tumours with a rim of non -
malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node
sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery
should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be
safely performed.

Radiotherapy recommendations
In SIOP−2001, around 25% of children with Wilms
tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or
metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio-
therapy guidelines used in SIOP−2001 were refined based
on the experience from a 2017 SIOP−2001 analysis and
prior COG–NWTS trials2,8,14,55(TABLE 4,5). The boost
dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III
intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA
protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP−2001 data
in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was
observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manu-
script submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung
irradiation was decreased from 15  Gy to 12 Gy in the
UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS
experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall
survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-
histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin,
actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs13.
               Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for
intermediate- risk or high-risk histology tumours
with major (visible on imaging or during surgery)
preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or
macro scopic peritoneal deposits.
               Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for
lung metastases lacking complete response by post-
operative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority
of patients achieving a complete response after induc -
tion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need
radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival
even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS
92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-
risk histology, both of which are asso  ciated with poor
survival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio -
therapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with
second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence
in the lung, whole-lung ir  radiation is recommended for
patients who did not receive lung irradiation during
first-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.
               Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults

of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi-
atric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II
Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not
performed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in
UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes
and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of
radiotherapy be discussed.
               The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed
description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that
advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if
they are available. The potential role of proton ther-
apy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours
has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and
needs further investigation before implementation in
the UMBRELLA protocol57.
