**Abstract:** The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
This Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups.  These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts within the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured that all relevant evidence, including the results of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial (investigating the safety of omitting doxorubicin in intermediate-risk stage II-III Wilms tumors), was incorporated.  Over the past 15 years, ongoing discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops have refined global strategies for treating children with renal tumors, leading to the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Wilms tumor treatment is tailored to the individual patient, considering tumor stage and histology.  Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy.  Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has successfully decreased for most patients, resulting in a survival rate of approximately 90%.  Identifying additional predictive and prognostic factors is crucial for improving patient stratification based on individual risk. Currently, about two-thirds of patients receive chemotherapy using only actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from doxorubicin.  Surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are continuously improving with advancements in technique.
</chunk>

<chunk>
For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol mirrors the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommending preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients diagnosed with Wilms tumor at or after 6 months of age. This approach is supported by previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG), demonstrating reduced tumor size and improved outcomes.  However, for children under 6 months old, direct surgery is recommended instead of preoperative chemotherapy, with fine-needle biopsy considered for patients with atypical clinical presentations or imaging findings. Routine histological assessment before treatment isn't advocated to avoid delays. This approach minimizes the risk of unnecessarily treating non-Wilms tumors with chemotherapy.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Preoperative chemotherapy also allows for personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity and identification of high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The SIOP-RTSG's centralized histology review demonstrates that identifying blastemal subtypes is feasible and clinically relevant.  The definition of blastemal-type histology may improve by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, a point that will be further investigated in the UMBRELLA protocol.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol aims to comprehensively collect information on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol.  Data collection will be combined with biomarker and imaging studies to refine future stratification methods.  The experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial, a 27-week regimen of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin, has been adopted as the standard treatment for most patients with stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This regimen showed a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival compared to the standard arm (vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin) in the SIOP-2001 trial and had no effect on overall survival.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Post-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data examined the association between omitting doxorubicin and outcomes in patients with large-volume tumors (>500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumor types were excluded, leaving only stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors.  Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 80% for patients with large-volume tumors versus 90% for those with small-volume tumors (log-rank P=0.01).  However, adding doxorubicin to the treatment regimen significantly improved EFS (93% vs. 67%, log-rank P=0.0005) for large-volume tumors.  Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  The UMBRELLA protocol will continue to treat blastemal-type tumors according to the SIOP-2001 regimen.  A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials showed that intensifying treatment in SIOP-2001 for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log-rank P=0.006), avoiding intensive treatment for relapse in many patients.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Approximately 17% of patients with Wilms tumors present with stage IV disease at diagnosis.  This is defined as hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most common.  Increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of small pulmonary nodules.

CT-only nodules are not visible on chest radiography. Similar to the COG protocol, CT-only nodules are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm (REFS 22,24,25).  Presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP-RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions with those with true localized disease. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups.  Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or secondary malignancies.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Similar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61-67% of patients have complete metastatic response before surgery. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered in order to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m² in SIOP-2001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² for patients with favourable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m², vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of 250 mg/m², or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150mg/m²/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m²/day), cyclophosphamide (450mg/m²/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m²). Stratification is based on local stage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary tumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).

</chunk>
<chunk>
Notably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centres discuss the best current treatment approach with the principle investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.

Figure 3 shows a post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumors in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.  The association of tumor volume and treatment with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) is presented using Kaplan-Meier curves.  AV-2 refers to actinomycin D, vincristine (27 weeks), and AVD refers to actinomycin D, vincristine, and doxorubicin.  The data shows survival probabilities at 60 months for different tumor volumes and treatment regimens.  Detailed numbers for each group at various time points are provided in the figure.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors (stage V) account for approximately 5-8% of Wilms tumor instances.  Long-term overall survival is currently around 80%, but end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a significant morbidity for patients with this condition.  ESRD can result from underlying germline genetic aberrations or treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue.  Studies have shown that nephron-sparing surgery leads to significantly better functional renal outcomes compared to other surgical approaches. Children with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash syndrome, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations are at increased risk of ESRD.  Therefore, avoiding total nephrectomy during initial surgery is recommended for bilateral tumors.  However, other causes of ESRD exist, including tumor recurrence necessitating bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is crucial after treating bilateral disease.  The SIOP-2001 study used preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine and actinomycin D) until nephron-sparing surgery was feasible, with response evaluations every 4 weeks.  However, prolonged preoperative chemotherapy may be ineffective, especially for chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtypes, and can increase the risk of anaplasia, disease progression, and metastasis.  The UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with evaluations every 6 weeks, aiming for consistency with the COG approach in future studies.  Misdiagnosis of synchronous bilateral renal tumors (other than Wilms tumors) is rare.  In cases of nonresponsiveness or inoperability, switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is suggested, avoiding anthracyclines, and a biopsy may be needed to determine histology.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol provides guidelines for treating patients with relapsed Wilms tumors.  Retrospective studies indicate that initial histology and first-line treatment are the best prognostic factors.  Patients with relapsed tumors are classified into three groups (AA, BB, and CC) based on these factors. Group AA includes patients with initial stage I-II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumors who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) as first-line treatment.  Treatment for group AA involves a four-drug combination (doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin and/or etoposide). This combination has been tested in the UKW-R and NWTS-5 relapse protocols.  Group BB consists of patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology who received doxorubicin in their initial treatment. Their treatment includes an intensive reinduction regimen combining etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide, followed by high-dose melphalan.
</chunk>


<chunk>
Table 2 presents a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms tumor (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is organized by metastasis surgery status (complete remission, partial response/stable disease, progressive disease), Wilms tumor histology (risk level and presence/absence of metastasis), and the recommended treatment.  Treatments include various chemotherapy regimens (AVD150, AVD250, four-drug regimen), radiotherapy, and surgery, with decisions dependent on the assessment of viable tumor, metastasis presence, and the patient's response to prior treatments.  For complete remission or very good partial remission with surgical resection, AVD150 or AVD250 are prescribed, with radiotherapy only indicated if complete resection of viable metastasis isn't achieved.  Partial or stable disease management varies based on the feasibility of resection and the presence/type of metastasis, with treatment options involving radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination of both.  Progressive disease treatment mainly relies on the four-drug regimen and radiotherapy.  In cases of high-risk disease or where metastatic disease must be confirmed, specific advice and tailored treatment plans are necessary.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The text following Table 2 discusses the rationale behind certain treatment choices within the UMBRELLA-SIOP-RTSG-2016 protocol.  The discussion centers around acceptable response rates observed with various chemotherapy combinations, including cyclophosphamide and etoposide, carboplatin and etoposide, and ifosfamide.  Ifosfamide demonstrated increased response rates but also a higher risk of nephrotoxicity.  To mitigate this risk, the protocol recommends alternating cyclophosphamide with ifosfamide.  The heterogeneous results from previous high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) trials led to a flexible approach for the consolidation phase, with high-dose chemotherapy administered at the discretion of the treating physician. The study aims to document the results prospectively in an observational manner.  The text also addresses the treatment of relapsed cases, particularly those with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors.  The protocol suggests using camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or other novel compounds for patients unresponsive to salvage treatment, acknowledging the likelihood of chemotherapy resistance in these cases.  The SIOP-RTSG supports initiatives promoting the development of new drugs for children with cancer. Finally, the text highlights the lack of systematic exploration of local treatment approaches, such as radiotherapy and surgical excision, for relapsing tumor masses.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery administration during Wilms tumor relapse.  These guidelines encompass considering resection after proven relapse disease reduction following chemotherapy, irrespective of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery is feasible or histological tumor response evaluation is beneficial.  Applying radiotherapy to initially unirradiated sites is standard practice; however, establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites is challenging due to the variability of situations.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises consulting with radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel for such cases.

For infants (under 6 months), the UMBRELLA protocol recommends primary surgery unless a multidisciplinary team deems immediate nephrectomy unsuitable.  This approach is due to the higher proportion of congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors in infants, which either require surgery alone or alternative chemotherapy. Percutaneous needle biopsy is suggested for stage IV disease or when surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants mirrors that of older children, with dose adjustments based on age and weight, according to SIOP studies.

The UMBRELLA protocol provides comprehensive guidelines for managing adult Wilms tumors, acknowledging the frequent delays and poor outcomes experienced by adults. Diagnosis in adults is uncommon, often occurring unexpectedly after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended when Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are high-risk factors in adults, with no evidence suggesting better outcomes for focal anaplasia.  Treatment for adults differs significantly from pediatric protocols due to the often considerable delay before starting postoperative chemotherapy.  The standard pediatric treatment (actinomycin D and vincristine) for stage I disease is only suitable for a select group of adults without anaplasia.  Other adults receive more intensive treatment, ranging from vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (for nonanaplastic subtypes) to a four-drug regimen (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors.  Exceptions are made in cases with favorable histology stage II tumors, allowing for timely chemotherapy initiation.  Adult vincristine doses are lower due to the increased risk of severe neurological toxicities.</chunk>

<chunk>
For children, the standard treatment for Wilms tumor is radical nephrectomy following preoperative chemotherapy. The UMBRELLA protocol emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, aiming to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for accurate staging.  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors meeting specific criteria: small tumor volume (<300 ml), and expectation of substantial remaining kidney function in patients without lymph node involvement.  A new classification system for NSS, developed by SIOP-RTSG, was incorporated into the UMBRELLA protocol to improve outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess NSS feasibility and minimize the risk of upstaging from incomplete tumor resection.  The table below summarizes the classification of nephron-sparing surgery, outlining the surgical technique, resection margins, and remaining renal parenchyma.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centers. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumors with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumors underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumors is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al., unpublished data, manuscript submitted).  Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favorable histology tumors after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumors with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumor rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%)<sup>1</sup>. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of <40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs<sup>2</sup>. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology<sup>3</sup>.

Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumors, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike pediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumors, as lymph node sampling is often not performed<sup>4</sup>. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumors has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol<sup>5</sup>.

The UMBRELLA protocol will guide the treatment of Wilms tumors in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond. This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumor protocol published to date, facilitating significant international research.  In Europe alone, approximately 1,000 pediatric renal tumor cases are diagnosed annually. While survival rates are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG aims to address geographical inequalities in childhood cancer survival by implementing a standardized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  It's estimated that about 300 cases of complex renal tumors in Europe could benefit from multidisciplinary discussion and treatment by experts.  Examples include bilateral Wilms tumors, cases with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors.  International collaboration is crucial to provide these patients access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials.

Initiatives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net) aim to enhance collaboration.  ExPO-R-Net is an online consultation platform with identified national reference centers (Figure 4). This platform is expected to facilitate the establishment of international tumor boards, secure funding for coordinators, provide IT platforms and logistics, and extend outreach to low-income countries.  The UMBRELLA protocol serves as a valuable guideline for routine clinical practice and should significantly stimulate international collaboration and research.  By standardizing treatment across all Wilms tumor types, the protocol allows for the prospective collection of data from a large, homogenous patient cohort. This data will be crucial for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and identification of therapeutic targets.  The UMBRELLA protocol will act as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard, forming the foundation for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials. Ongoing collaboration with the COG (Children's Oncology Group) is vital.  Global collaboration remains essential for developing effective treatments for challenging cases, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk Wilms tumors. The UMBRELLA protocol will contribute substantially to achieving this goal.
