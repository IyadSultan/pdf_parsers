**Abstract:** The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol.  The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

<chunk>
Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment to the treatment schedules.

<chunk>
This Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups. These recommendations resulted from a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the incorporation of all relevant evidence, particularly the results of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which examined the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating intermediate-risk stage II-III Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, extensive discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops have refined these recommendations and shaped global strategies for treating children with renal tumors.  This data sharing has directly influenced the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Wilms tumor treatment is tailored to the individual patient, considering tumor stage and histology.  Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy.  Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced, leading to a 90% survival rate for most patients.  However, identifying additional predictive and prognostic factors is crucial for improving patient stratification based on risk.  Currently, approximately two-thirds of patients receive chemotherapy with only actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from doxorubicin.  As new techniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are constantly improving.  For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommends preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients over 26 months old, based on the results of previous SIOP trials which demonstrated tumor downstaging. This benefit was independently confirmed by the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).
</chunk>

<chunk>
In patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin can be reduced by 20% compared to those undergoing direct nephrectomy without affecting survival.  The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosing Wilms tumor and recommends direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children under 6 months old.  Fine-needle biopsies are considered for patients with unusual clinical presentations or imaging findings. To prevent treatment delays, routine histological assessment before treatment is not recommended. This approach is safe and efficiently identifies non-Wilms tumors, preventing unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy also allows for personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity and helps identify high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The centralized review process within the SIOP-RTSG shows that identifying the blastemal subtype is clinically relevant.  However, the definition of blastemal-type histology could be improved by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, a subject for further investigation within the UMBRELLA protocol.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol aims to comprehensively collect data on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, mirroring the approach of SIOP-2001. Prospective data collection will be analyzed alongside integrated biomarker and imaging studies to potentially refine stratification methods in future protocols.  The experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial, which used 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin, has been adopted as the standard treatment for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  While this regimen showed a non-significant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm in SIOP-2001, post-hoc analysis revealed a significant improvement in EFS (93% versus 67%, log rank P=0.0005) when doxorubicin was added for large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  Therefore, the inclusion of doxorubicin is recommended for these patients in the UMBRELLA protocol.  Treatment for blastemal-type tumors will continue to follow the SIOP-2001 regimen.
</chunk>

<chunk>
A comparison of the SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials demonstrated that intensifying treatment in SIOP-2001 for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006) while avoiding extensive treatment for relapse in a substantial number of patients.  Approximately 17% of patients with Wilms tumors present with stage IV disease at diagnosis. This is defined by hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites; or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most common. The increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of smaller pulmonary nodules.

# CONSENSUS STATEMENT

**(Figure 2) Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial. Association of tumour volume with (a) event-free survival (EFS) and (b) overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier curves.**

Two Kaplan-Meier curves are presented, illustrating the association between tumor volume and both event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).  The first graph (a) shows a clear difference in 60-month EFS between patients with tumors <500ml (90.3%; 95% CI: 87.1-93.5) and those with tumors ≥500ml (80.0%; 95% CI: 70.5-90.8), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.38 (95% CI: 1.26-4.51) and a significant log-rank P-value of 0.01. The second graph (b) displays a similar trend for OS, though the difference is less pronounced.  The 60-month OS for <500ml tumors is 96.7% (95% CI: 94.6-98.8) compared to 93.1% (95% CI: 86.8-99.9) for ≥500ml tumors. The HR is 2.51 (95% CI: 0.87-7.24), with a log-rank P-value of 0.08, suggesting a trend but not reaching statistical significance.  Both graphs include tables showing the number of patients at each time point.  CT-only nodules, not visible on chest radiography, are considered in the analysis.


</chunk>
<chunk>
The definition of lung nodules and their treatment as metastases is consistent with the UMBRELLA protocol for CT-only nodules with a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm.  The presence of these CT-only nodules correlates with increased relapse risk and reduced survival.  Studies from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 demonstrated that patients with CT-only nodules treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS than those treated with vincristine and actinomycin D alone, although overall survival was similar between the groups.  Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease is advantageous for intermediate-risk or low-risk histology patients who achieve a rapid complete response in their CT-only nodules.  This approach reduces the need for pulmonary radiotherapy and, consequently, minimizes the risk of severe long-term sequelae like lung disease, cardiac complications, or secondary malignancies.

Preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol mirrors the SIOP-2001 approach, involving a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for six weeks, followed by reassessment imaging (MRI for local tumors, CT and/or MRI for metastatic sites) before surgery.  This preoperative regimen yields a 61-67% complete metastatic response rate before surgery.  Postoperative chemotherapy guidelines are detailed, with a reduction in the cumulative doxorubicin dose to mitigate cardiac toxicity.  The cumulative doxorubicin dose in SIOP-2001 for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m².  However, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggests that a 150 mg/m² cumulative doxorubicin dose is sufficient for patients with favorable histology without significantly impacting survival.

</chunk>
<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients into three groups based on cumulative doxorubicin dose: 150 mg/m² (vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin), 250 mg/m² (same drugs), or a four-drug regimen (etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m²).  Stratification considers the local stage of the primary tumor, histology of both primary and metastatic tumors (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and the response to preoperative treatment and surgery.  Patients with metastatic disease and high-risk histological characteristics represent a rare subgroup with a poor prognosis, with only a few patients per year falling into this category.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises local centers to discuss optimal treatment strategies for stage IV disease with the principal investigator.  The SIOP-RTSG board proposes a regimen based on COG data, incorporating vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (at the treating physician's discretion). The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy remains debated, although some studies show a trend towards favorable outcomes.  This suggested regimen is detailed in the UMBRELLA protocol's appendix.  Data on regimen use and outcomes will be prospectively tracked in the SIOP database for further descriptive study.

Figure 3 shows a post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumors in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.  The association of tumor volume and treatment with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) is presented using Kaplan-Meier curves.  Two treatment arms are compared:  AV-2 (actinomycin D, vincristine) and AVD (actinomycin D, vincristine, and doxorubicin).  The data shows that for both EFS and OS, the outcome is significantly better for patients with smaller tumors (<500 ml) compared to those with larger tumors (500+ ml). This difference is statistically significant (Log-Rank P<0.0005 for EFS and P=0.1 for OS).  The tables accompanying the graphs detail the number of patients at each time point for each treatment group and tumor volume category.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors (stage V) account for approximately 5-8% of Wilms tumor cases. While long-term overall survival is currently around 80%, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major morbidity concern.  ESRD can result from underlying germline genetic aberrations or treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue.  Studies have shown that nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) leads to significantly better functional renal outcomes compared to other surgical approaches. Patients with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash syndrome, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations are at a higher risk of ESRD.  The UMBRELLA protocol advocates for avoiding total nephrectomy during initial surgery for bilateral tumors. However, other factors can contribute to ESRD, including tumor recurrence necessitating bilateral nephrectomy or the need for renal irradiation.  Long-term monitoring of renal function is crucial after treatment for bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine and actinomycin D) until NSS was feasible, with assessments every 4 weeks.  However, prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective, particularly in chemotherapy-resistant stromal subtypes.  It can also increase the risk of anaplasia, disease progression, and metastasis.  Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with evaluations every 6 weeks.  This approach aims for consistency with the COG approach in future studies.  Misdiagnosis of synchronous bilateral renal tumors other than Wilms tumors is extremely rare.  If the tumor proves unresponsive or inoperable, a switch to etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, avoiding anthracyclines. A biopsy is considered to determine the histology.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for managing relapsed Wilms tumors.  Retrospective studies have indicated that initial histology and first-line treatment are key prognostic factors.  Patients with relapsed tumors are classified into three groups (AA, BB, and CC) based on these factors.  Group AA includes patients with initial stage I-II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumors treated with only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (without radiotherapy).  Their treatment involves a four-drug combination (doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin and/or etoposide). This combination has been tested in the UKW-R and NWTS-5 relapse protocols, although drug combinations and doses varied. Group BB consists of patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology who have already received doxorubicin. They receive an intensive reinduction regimen including etoposide and carboplatin, with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide, followed by high-dose melphalan.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Table 2 provides a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms tumor (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is organized by metastasis surgery, Wilms tumor histology, and treatment.  For patients with complete remission or very good partial remission after surgical complete resection, the treatment depends on the risk level (low or intermediate) and the presence and size of lung nodules.  Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease with lung nodules 3-5mm receives AVD150 treatment with pulmonary radiotherapy only if complete resection of viable metastasis is achieved.  Similarly,  low-risk or intermediate-risk disease with lung nodules larger than 5mm or other sites receives AVD250 treatment with pulmonary radiotherapy only following complete resection of viable metastasis.  For cases with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease and no evidence of metastasis, treatment is localized.

For patients with a partial response or stable disease, the treatment differs based on whether representative nodule resection is feasible and the risk level. If resection is feasible and the disease is low-risk, the treatment is AVD250 with lung or metastasis radiotherapy and a CT scan at week 10.  If remaining nodules are present, surgery is recommended to achieve a complete response if feasible.  If the disease is low-risk with confirmed viable metastasis, AVD150 and CT scan at week 10 are performed, followed by surgery if remaining nodules persist to achieve complete response if possible. The protocol also dictates the need to contact the principal investigator for potentially different treatment approaches. For low-risk disease with completely necrotic metastasis, the treatment involves contacting the principal investigator to determine the best course of action.  If the disease is intermediate-risk, various treatment regimes involving radiotherapy and surgery are prescribed based on whether viable metastasis is present or absent.  Resection not feasible scenarios have different treatment plans based on risk levels.

Progressive disease cases also have varying treatment protocols based on the risk level and confirmation of metastasis.  High-risk disease patients receive advice from the principal investigator, with radiotherapy to metastases being administered.  The table concludes with a note about treatment for mixed cases requiring confirmation of metastatic disease through histology, with treatment based on the worst histology and response. The footnote clarifies the meaning of abbreviations used (AVD, CDCV) and the source of the protocol.

The text following the table discusses the rationale behind certain treatment choices within the UMBRELLA-SIOP-RTSG-2016 protocol.  The acceptable response rates observed with various chemotherapeutic combinations are detailed, with a focus on reducing the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity. The heterogeneity in settings where high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) were explored, leading to inconclusive results, prompted a flexible approach to the consolidation phase.  This approach allows the treating physician discretion in using high-dose chemotherapy, with the intent to document findings prospectively.

A separate category (group CC) encompasses patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For relapsing patients without response to initial salvage treatments, the protocol recommends trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, considering the likelihood of chemotherapy resistance.  The study highlights the commitment to supporting new drug development initiatives in pediatric oncology, specifically mentioning collaborations with the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.  The text concludes by emphasizing that local treatment strategies, such as radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses, have not yet undergone systematic exploration.

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery at relapse in Wilms tumor patients.  These guidelines include considering resection after proven disease reduction following chemotherapy, regardless of histological subtype or risk group, when feasible radical surgery is possible or when evaluating histological tumor response is beneficial.  Radiotherapy on initially unirradiated sites is widely accepted; however, establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites proves challenging due to the diverse clinical scenarios.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises consulting radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel in such cases.

For infants (under 6 months), the UMBRELLA protocol generally recommends primary surgery unless a multidisciplinary team deems immediate nephrectomy unsuitable. This approach is favored because a higher proportion of infant renal tumors are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, requiring either surgery alone or intensive chemotherapy, respectively.  Percutaneous needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when surgery is deemed difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants mirrors that of older children, adjusting drug doses based on age and weight according to prior SIOP studies.

The UMBRELLA protocol provides comprehensive guidelines for adult Wilms tumor management, acknowledging the often lengthy treatment delays and resultant poor outcomes observed in adults.  Adult Wilms tumor diagnosis is unusual, frequently discovered incidentally during nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery. Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk factors in adults, with no evidence suggesting improved outcomes for focal anaplasia.  Treatment strategies differ from pediatric guidelines due to frequent treatment delays in adults requiring verification of histology.  Therefore, the pediatric stage I treatment regimen (actinomycin D and vincristine) is only suitable for a select group of adults with stage I disease and no anaplasia.  Other adults receive more intensive treatment, ranging from vincristine and actinomycin D with doxorubicin (nonanaplastic subtypes) to a four-drug regimen (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors.  Exceptions might be made for cases with favorable histology and timely diagnosis, allowing for chemotherapy commencement within 14 days post-surgery.  Vincristine dosage is lower in adults due to the increased risk of severe neurological toxicity.</chunk>

<chunk>
Following preoperative chemotherapy in children, radical nephrectomy is the standard treatment for Wilms tumor.  The UMBRELLA protocol emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, aiming to sample seven locoregional nodes for accurate staging. Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now an acceptable option for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors meeting specific criteria outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol. These criteria include small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of substantial remaining kidney function in patients without lymph node involvement.  A new NSS classification system, adopted from a collaboration of SIOP-RTSG surgeons and pathologists, facilitates improved outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and mitigate the risk of upstaging through incomplete tumor resection.  Table 3 provides a detailed classification of nephron-sparing surgery aspects, including surgical techniques (partial nephrectomy or enucleation), surgical and pathological resection margins, and the remaining renal parenchyma.</chunk>

<chunk>
Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (TABLE 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.

Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.

# Consensus Statement

## International collaboration

The UMBRELLA protocol will guide treatment of Wilms tumour treatment in over 50 countries in Europe and beyond, making it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumour protocol published to date, enabling international research to be conducted. In Europe alone, about 1,000 instances of paediatric renal tumours are diagnosed each year. In general, survival is excellent, but the SIOP-RTSG aims to address the current geographic inequalities in childhood cancer survival by providing a standardized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. Furthermore, estimates suggest that ~300 instances of complex renal tumours in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treatment with clinicians at centres of expertise. Examples include most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, patients with extensive intravascular tumour thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these diseases could benefit from international collaboration to access specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials. European initiatives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-r-Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim to enhance such collaboration.  The EXPO-R-Net is an online consultation platform for which national reference centres have been identified (FIG. 4), and this platform should contribute to the establishment of international tumour boards, funding for coordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future outreach to low-income countries.

## Conclusions

As well as providing a useful guideline for routine clinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should stimulate international collaboration and research. By standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumour types, prospectively collected data from a large, homogeneous cohort of patients will be available for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and therapeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA protocol can serve as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard. It will be the backbone for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration with the COG will continue to be sought. Global collaboration is still necessary for finding effective treatments for the most unfavourable Wilms tumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA protocol will contribute to this aim.
