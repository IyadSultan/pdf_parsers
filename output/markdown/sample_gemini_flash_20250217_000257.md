**Abstract** | The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment
</chunk>

<chunk>
The Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  This protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups.  The recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Extensive communication with colleagues in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the integration of all relevant evidence, particularly the findings of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops have refined recommendations and shaped global strategies for treating children with renal tumors.  These collaborative efforts led to the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment, leveraging shared data and knowledge.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Wilms tumor treatment is tailored to the individual patient based on tumor stage and histology, typically involving a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced, leading to a survival rate of around 90%.  However, identifying additional predictive and prognostic factors remains crucial for improved patient stratification.  Currently, roughly two-thirds of Wilms tumor patients receive chemotherapy with only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from the addition of doxorubicin.  As new surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques emerge, further improvements in treatment are expected.
</chunk>

<chunk>
For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol largely follows the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommending preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients over 6 months old.  This approach is based on results from previous SIOP trials demonstrating tumor downstaging and is supported by the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).  Preoperative chemotherapy allows for a reduction in the need for radiotherapy or doxorubicin without compromising survival.  The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosing Wilms tumor and recommends direct surgery for children under 6 months or fine-needle biopsy for those with unusual clinical presentations or imaging findings, avoiding unnecessary delays in treatment. Routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated due to its potential for causing delays and risk of overtreatment. Preoperative chemotherapy also enables personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity, facilitating identification of high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors.  The centralized review process within SIOP-RTSG highlights the importance and feasibility of identifying this subtype.  Further refinements to the definition of blastemal histology may involve focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema instead of the relative percentage, a factor that the UMBRELLA protocol will investigate.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol aims to collect comprehensive data on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol. Prospective data will be collected and analyzed, incorporating biomarker and imaging studies to refine future stratification.  The experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial, consisting of 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin, has been adopted as the standard management regimen for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This regimen showed a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm of SIOP-2001, which included doxorubicin.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Post-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data examined the impact of omitting doxorubicin in patients with large-volume tumors (>500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy).  Stromal and epithelial tumor types were excluded, leaving only stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors for analysis.  In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with large-volume tumors had a 5-year EFS of 80% compared to 90% for those with small-volume tumors (log rank P=0.01).  Crucially, adding doxorubicin significantly improved EFS (93% versus 67%, log rank P=0.0005) for large-volume tumors. Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  Treatment for blastemal-type tumors will continue to follow the SIOP-2001 regimen.  A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials demonstrated that intensifying treatment in SIOP-2001 for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006), reducing the need for intensive relapse treatment.


</chunk>
<chunk>
Approximately 17% of Wilms tumor patients present with stage IV disease at diagnosis. This is defined by hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are most common. Increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of small pulmonary nodules.

CT-only nodules are not visible on chest radiography. Similar to the COG protocol, CT-only nodules are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm (REFS 22,24,25).  Presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP-RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions with those with true localized disease<sup>1</sup>. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups<sup>2</sup>. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or secondary malignancies.

</chunk>
<chunk>
Similar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61-67% of patients have complete metastatic response before surgery<sup>3</sup>. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered in order to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m² in SIOP-2001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² for patients with favourable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m², vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of 250 mg/m², or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150mg/m²/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m²/day), cyclophosphamide (450mg/m²/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m²). Stratification is based on local stage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary tumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).

</chunk>
<chunk>
Notably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centres discuss the best current treatment approach with the principle investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings<sup>4</sup>. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.

Figure 3 shows a post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumors in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.  The association of tumor volume and treatment with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) is illustrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.  AV-2 refers to the treatment regimen of actinomycin D and vincristine (27 weeks), while AVD includes actinomycin D, vincristine, and doxorubicin.  The data presented includes 60-month EFS and OS probabilities for different tumor volume groups (AVD <500ml, AV-2 <500ml, AVD 500+ml, AV-2 500+ml) and shows statistically significant differences in survival outcomes between groups.  The tables below the graphs provide the number of patients at risk at various time points for each treatment and volume group.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors (stage V) account for approximately 5-8% of Wilms tumor cases.  Long-term overall survival is currently around 80%, but end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a significant morbidity for patients with this condition.  ESRD can result from underlying germline genetic aberrations or treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Studies have shown that nephron-sparing surgery leads to significantly better functional renal outcomes compared to other surgical approaches.  Children with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash syndrome, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations have an increased risk of ESRD.  Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol advises against total nephrectomy for bilateral tumors at initial surgery. However, other factors can also cause ESRD, such as tumor recurrence necessitating bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation.  Long-term monitoring of renal function is crucial after treatment for bilateral disease.  In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine and actinomycin D) until nephron-sparing surgery was feasible.  Response evaluations were conducted every 4 weeks. However, prolonged preoperative chemotherapy has been shown to be ineffective for many bilateral tumors (especially the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and may increase the risk of anaplasia, disease progression, and metastasis.  To address this, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with evaluation intervals set at 6 weeks.  This approach aligns with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) methodology.  The occurrence of misdiagnosis, where synchronous bilateral renal tumors other than Wilms tumors are present, is extremely rare. If a tumor is unresponsive or inoperable, a switch to etoposide and carboplatin treatment is recommended, avoiding anthracyclines.  A biopsy may be performed to determine the histology.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for managing relapsed Wilms tumors.  Retrospective studies indicate that initial histology and first-line treatment are the best prognostic factors.  Patients with relapsed tumors are categorized into three groups (AA, BB, and CC) based on these factors. Group AA includes patients with initial stage I-II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumors who only received vincristine and/or actinomycin D (without radiotherapy) during their first-line treatment.  Treatment for group AA involves a four-drug regimen (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin and/or etoposide). This regimen has been previously tested in the UKW-R and NWTS-5 relapse protocols, though drug combinations and doses varied. Group BB encompasses patients who did not have initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology but already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment.  Their treatment involves an intensive reinduction regimen including etoposide and carboplatin, with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide, followed by high-dose melphalan.

<chunk>
Table 2 provides a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms Tumor (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is organized by metastasis surgery status (complete remission, partial response, progressive disease), Wilms tumor histology (risk level and presence/absence of metastasis), and the corresponding treatment.  For example, patients with complete remission and low-risk disease with lung nodules 3-5mm receive AVD150 treatment, with pulmonary radiotherapy only if complete resection of viable metastasis isn't achieved.  Similarly,  patients with partial response, low-risk disease, and viable metastasis confirmed undergo AVD250 treatment (lung or metastasis radiotherapy) followed by surgery if there are remaining nodules at week 10.  Progressive disease scenarios lead to four-drug regimens with radiotherapy to metastases, sometimes including surgery if nodules remain at week 10.  The table highlights the individualized approach to treatment based on the patient's specific response and tumor characteristics. Treatment decisions may involve consultation with the principal investigator in certain scenarios. Finally, the table indicates that if metastatic disease is present, treatment is determined by the worst histology and worst response observed.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The text following the table discusses the rationale behind the chosen treatment strategies. Autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) and further reinduction courses are options, depending on the physician's judgment. Acceptable response rates have been noted with cyclophosphamide/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide combinations; however, ifosfamide showed a higher response rate in early trials.  To mitigate ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide. The heterogeneous results from prior high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR studies have prompted a flexible approach to the consolidation phase, leaving high-dose chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician. A prospective observational study is planned to analyze the results.

The discussion then shifts to patients in the relapsed group CC (those with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors).  For these patients and other relapsing patients without a response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol suggests trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds. This is because these patients have already received standard therapies, and resistance is expected. The SIOP-RTSG collaboration is committed to fostering new drug development efforts, exemplified by their involvement in initiatives such as the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.  The text concludes by highlighting the under-exploration of local treatment approaches (radiotherapy and surgical excision) for recurring tumor masses.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery administration at relapse.  These guidelines encompass considering resection after proven disease reduction following chemotherapy, irrespective of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery appears feasible or when evaluating histological tumor response is beneficial.  Applying radiotherapy to initially untreated areas is widely accepted; however, establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites remains challenging due to the varied situations encountered.  The UMBRELLA protocol suggests consulting radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel in such cases.

For infants (under 6 months), primary surgery is recommended according to the UMBRELLA protocol unless immediate nephrectomy is deemed unsuitable by a multidisciplinary team. This approach is prioritized because infants have a higher incidence of congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, which either require surgery alone or alternative chemotherapy. Percutaneous needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor is similar for infants and older children who undergo direct nephrectomy, adjusting dosages based on age and weight using previous SIOP studies.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides comprehensive guidelines for managing adult Wilms tumors, acknowledging extended treatment delays and their negative impact on outcomes.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Adult Wilms tumor diagnosis is infrequent and treatment recommendations stem from literature reviews and international consensus, as detailed in a 2011 publication.  Adult Wilms tumor is often unexpectedly discovered after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if Wilms tumor is confirmed histologically before surgery.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia in adults are considered high-risk subtypes.  Adults frequently experience substantial delays before beginning postoperative chemotherapy due to histological verification, making direct application of pediatric regimens unsuitable.  The treatment for stage I adult patients without anaplasia might involve actinomycin D and vincristine, while others receive more intensive regimens (vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for nonanaplastic subtypes, or carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin for anaplastic tumors).  Exceptions can be made when a favorable histology stage II tumor is diagnosed promptly, allowing for chemotherapy to start within 14 days of surgery.  Vincristine dosages are lower in adults to minimize severe neurological toxicity.
</chunk>

<chunk>
For children with Wilms tumor, the standard treatment is radical nephrectomy after preoperative chemotherapy, as outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This protocol emphasizes lymph node sampling, aiming for seven locoregional nodes for accurate staging. Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is acceptable for unilateral, nonsyndromic Wilms tumors under specific conditions (small tumor volume &lt;300 ml, substantial remaining kidney function, no lymph node involvement).  The UMBRELLA protocol uses a new NSS classification system, developed by SIOP-RTSG surgeons and pathologists, to facilitate outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging caused by incomplete tumor resection.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs.  Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.

Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.
</chunk>
<chunk>
Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.

The UMBRELLA protocol will guide the treatment of Wilms tumors in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond. This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumor protocol published to date, facilitating significant international research. In Europe alone, approximately 1,000 pediatric renal tumors are diagnosed annually. While survival rates are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG aims to address geographical disparities in childhood cancer survival by implementing standardized approaches to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  Estimates suggest that about 300 cases of complex renal tumors in Europe could benefit from multidisciplinary discussions involving expert clinicians. These cases often include bilateral Wilms tumors, those with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors.  International collaboration will be crucial to provide access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials.

European initiatives, such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net) (http://www.expornet.eu/), are designed to enhance collaboration.  ExPO-R-Net serves as an online consultation platform identifying national reference centers (Figure 4). This platform is expected to facilitate the establishment of international tumor boards, secure funding for coordinators, provide IT platform support and logistics, and extend future outreach to low-income countries.  The UMBRELLA protocol will not only serve as a useful guideline for routine clinical practice but also stimulate international collaboration and research. By standardizing treatment across all Wilms tumor types, data collected from a large, homogeneous patient cohort will become available for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and therapeutic targets.

The UMBRELLA protocol will act as the SIOP-RTSG's best-available treatment standard. It will form the basis for future treatment approaches in phase I/II and randomized trials, with ongoing collaboration with the COG.  However, global collaboration remains essential to develop effective treatments for the most challenging Wilms tumor cases, including refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease. The UMBRELLA protocol is designed to significantly contribute to progress in these areas.  A table detailing the institutions and locations involved in the preliminary European surgical expert referral sites and overall subnetwork coordination is included in the original document.  References to supporting publications are also provided in the original document.
