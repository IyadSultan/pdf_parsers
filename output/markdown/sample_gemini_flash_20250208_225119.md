**Abstract** | The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours<sup>1</sup>. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol<sup>2</sup>. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations<sup>3</sup> (Fig. 1). The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy<sup>4</sup>.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment

This Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups. These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the incorporation of all relevant evidence, particularly from the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which examined the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, extensive discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG have refined these recommendations, leading to improved global strategies for children with renal tumors.  These discussions, held during meetings and workshops, facilitated the sharing of data and knowledge, directly informing the development of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnosis and treatment.

<chunk>
Treatment of Wilms tumors is individualized based on tumor stage and histology, typically involving a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced for most patients, resulting in a survival rate exceeding 90%.  The identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors is crucial for improved patient stratification based on individual risk. Currently, approximately two-thirds of patients receive chemotherapy with only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from doxorubicin.  Surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are continually improving as new techniques emerge. For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommends preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients diagnosed with Wilms tumor at or after 6 months of age. This recommendation is supported by previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG), which demonstrated the benefit of this regimen and the potential reduction of radiotherapy or doxorubicin in patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy. The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosing Wilms tumor, recommending direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children under 6 months of age and suggesting fine-needle biopsy for patients with atypical clinical presentations or imaging findings.  To prevent treatment delays, routine histological assessment before treatment is not routinely recommended.  This approach effectively identifies patients with non-Wilms tumors, minimizing unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Preoperative chemotherapy allows for personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity and facilitates the identification of high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The centralized review process within the SIOP-RTSG has proven the feasibility and clinical relevance of identifying this subtype. However, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be improved by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, a matter that will be further investigated within the UMBRELLA protocol.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol aims to comprehensively collect data on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol. Prospective data will be collected and analyzed, incorporating integrated biomarker and imaging studies to further refine stratification in future protocols.  The experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial, a 27-week regimen of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin, has been adopted as the standard for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This regimen resulted in a small, nonsignificant decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm in SIOP-2001, which included doxorubicin.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Post-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data focusing on large-volume tumors (>500ml after preoperative chemotherapy) revealed a significant association between omitting doxorubicin and poorer outcomes.  This analysis excluded stromal and epithelial tumor types due to their excellent prognosis, focusing instead on regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors.  The 5-year EFS for patients with large-volume tumors was 80%, compared to 90% for those with small-volume tumors (log rank P=0.01).  However, adding doxorubicin to the treatment regimen for large-volume tumors significantly improved EFS (93% vs 67%, log rank P=0.0005). Consequently, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  Treatment for blastemal-type tumors will continue to follow the SIOP-2001 regimen.  A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials showed that intensifying treatment for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006), reducing the need for intensive relapse treatment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Approximately 17% of Wilms tumor patients present with stage IV metastatic disease at diagnosis. This is characterized by hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most common. The increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of smaller pulmonary nodules.

CT-only nodules are not visible on chest radiography. Similar to the COG protocol, CT-only nodules are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm (REFS 22,24,25). Presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP-RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions with those with true localized disease<sup>1</sup>. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups<sup>2</sup>. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules.  These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or secondary malignancies.


</chunk>
<chunk>
Similar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61-67% of patients have complete metastatic response before surgery<sup>3</sup>. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered in order to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m² in SIOP-2001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² for patients with favourable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m², vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of 250 mg/m², or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150mg/m²/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m²/day), cyclophosphamide (450mg/m²/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m²). Stratification is based on local stage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary tumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).

</chunk>
<chunk>
Notably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centres discuss the best current treatment approach with the principle investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings<sup>4</sup>. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.

Bilateral disease (stage V). Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour (stage V) accounts for ~5–8% of instances of Wilms tumour and long-term overall survival is currently ~80%. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et al. observed that functional renal outcome was considerably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of ESRD. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol. However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies.
</chunk>
<chunk>
The occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.

Relapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used<sup>1–3</sup>. Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors. Treatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I–II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours, who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW-R protocol and the NWTS-5 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied<sup>4,5</sup>. Patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan

Table 2 presents a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms tumour (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is organized by metastasis surgery, Wilms tumor histology, and treatment.  For complete remission or very good partial remission, with surgical complete resection if needed, the treatment varies based on low-risk or intermediate-risk disease and the size of lung nodules (3-5 mm or >5mm).  Options include AVD150 (actinomycin-D, vincristine, and doxorubicin) with or without pulmonary radiotherapy, depending on complete resection of viable metastasis.  Similar treatment strategies are outlined for partial response or stable disease, considering factors like the presence of viable or necrotic metastasis, and whether resection is feasible.  In cases where resection is not feasible, treatment plans include four-drug regimens, radiotherapy to metastases, and the use of AVD250.  For progressive disease, irrespective of resection feasibility, four-drug regimens and radiotherapy are recommended.  Finally, for all cases involving high-risk disease, the principal investigator's advice is sought.  In cases where metastatic disease needs confirmation, histology is required.

The accompanying text discusses autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) and further reinduction courses as treatment options, with acceptable response rates observed using cyclophosphamide and etoposide combinations.  However, ifosfamide is noted to increase response rates but also carries the risk of nephrotoxicity. To mitigate this, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide. The heterogeneity of previous results concerning high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR led to a flexible approach during the consolidation phase, making high-dose chemotherapy a physician's discretion. The study aims to document results in a prospective observational fashion.  A separate group (CC) consists of patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors, as well as those who have not responded to salvage treatment. For this group, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds due to the likely development of chemotherapy-resistant disease.  The SIOP-RTSG supports initiatives in children's cancer drug development. Notably, approaches to local treatment (radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses) have not been systematically explored.

The UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery administration at relapse.  These guidelines encompass the consideration of resection after proven relapse disease reduction following chemotherapy, regardless of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery is feasible or when evaluating histological tumor response is beneficial.  Radiotherapy application to initially non-irradiated sites is widely accepted, but establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites proves challenging due to the diversity of situations encountered.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises consultation with radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel in such cases.

Infants, defined as patients younger than 6 months (182 days), are generally considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol, unless immediate nephrectomy is deemed unsuitable by a multidisciplinary team.  This preference for upfront nephrectomy in infants stems from the higher proportion of renal tumors in this age group being congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, which either require surgery alone or alternative chemotherapy. Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is difficult.  Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants mirrors that of older children who underwent direct nephrectomy, with dosage adjustments based on age and body weight, following the experience from previous SIOP studies.  The UMBRELLA protocol also provides comprehensive guidelines for managing adult Wilms tumors, acknowledging the extended treatment delays and resulting poor outcomes often experienced by this patient population.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The diagnosis of Wilms tumor in adults is rare, and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and broad international consensus, as published in 2011. Adult Wilms tumor is frequently diagnosed unexpectedly after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  In rare cases where Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery, preoperative chemotherapy is recommended, similar to childhood treatment strategies. Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk subtypes in adults, with no evidence supporting better outcomes for patients with focal anaplasia.

Adult patients often experience significant delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time required for histology verification.  Therefore, pediatric treatment regimens cannot be directly applied to adults.  For instance, the actinomycin D and vincristine regimen for pediatric stage I disease is only recommended for a select group of adult stage I patients without anaplasia.  Other adult patients receive more intensive treatment, either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (for nonanaplastic subtypes) or four drugs (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors of any stage.  Exceptions may be made when a stage II Wilms tumor with favorable histology is diagnosed promptly, allowing for chemotherapy to commence within 14 days of surgery.  Vincristine dosage is lower in adult guidelines compared to pediatric guidelines due to the increased risk of severe neurological toxicities in adults.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Following preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumor nephrectomy is the standard of care for children with Wilms tumor.  The UMBRELLA protocol details surgical guidelines, emphasizing the importance of lymph node sampling (aiming for seven locoregional lymph nodes) for accurate staging.  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors under specific conditions outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol: small tumor volume (<300ml) and the expectation of sufficient remaining kidney function in patients with tumors <300ml and no lymph node involvement.  A new NSS classification system, developed by a group of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP-RTSG, and adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol, optimizes outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging due to incomplete tumor resection.  (Table 3 provides a detailed classification of nephron-sparing aspects).
</chunk>


<chunk>
Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centers. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumors with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumors underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumors is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favorable histology tumors after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs.  Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumors with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumor rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.
</chunk>

Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of <40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.

Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumors, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike pediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumors, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumors has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.

The UMBRELLA protocol will guide the treatment of Wilms tumors in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond. This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumor protocol published to date, facilitating international research.  In Europe alone, approximately 1000 pediatric renal tumors are diagnosed annually. While survival rates are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG aims to address geographical inequalities in childhood cancer survival by implementing a standardized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  Estimates suggest that around 300 cases of complex renal tumors in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussions with experts.  Examples include bilateral Wilms tumors, cases with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complex metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors.  International collaboration will improve access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy, and phase I/II trials. Initiatives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-r-Net) aim to enhance this collaboration.  ExPO-R-Net is an online consultation platform with identified national reference centers; it should contribute to establishing international tumor boards, securing funding, providing IT support and logistics, and expanding outreach to low-income countries.

The UMBRELLA protocol serves as a valuable guideline for routine clinical practice and should stimulate international collaboration and research.  Standardization of treatment across all Wilms tumor types will allow for the collection of data from a large, homogenous patient cohort, enabling future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and therapeutic targets.  The protocol will act as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard, forming the foundation for future treatment approaches in phase I/II and randomized trials. Continued collaboration with the COG is anticipated.  However, global collaboration remains crucial for finding effective treatments for challenging cases, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk Wilms tumors, and the UMBRELLA protocol will actively support this endeavor.
