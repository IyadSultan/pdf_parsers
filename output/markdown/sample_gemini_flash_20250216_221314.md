**Abstract:** The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours.

Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.

The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.

Childhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80–90% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.

The UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment

This Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treatment of Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations were established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumors within the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic research.  Thorough communications were undertaken with colleagues with similar expertise involved in the Children's Oncology Group (COG), to ensure all relevant evidence was applied when deciding how to implement the results of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial, which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors, and to refine recommendations for patients with Wilms tumor. Over the past 15 years, wide-ranging discussions on global strategies for children with renal tumors have evolved between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops. These conversations have resulted in sharing of data and knowledge, which has been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment.
</chunk>

<chunk>
In general, treatment of Wilms tumors is tailored to the patient based on tumor stage and histology, and involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced for the majority of patients with Wilms tumors, and survival has risen to 90%. Consequently, the identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to improve the stratification of patients according to their individual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Wilms tumor now receive chemotherapy consisting of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vincristine. Other patients, including those with metastatic disease and high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to benefit from doxorubicin. Moreover, as innovative techniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are improving.

Localized disease. Similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol, the UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients newly diagnosed with Wilms tumor aged ≥6 months, based on results of previous SIOP trials that showed tumor downstaging using this regimen. This benefit was also independently observed in the randomized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, previously known as the UK Children's Cancer Study Group). In patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could be reduced by 20% compared with those treated with direct nephrectomy, with no significant difference in survival. The SIOP-RTSG accounts for the risk of misdiagnosis of Wilms tumor by recommending direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children &lt;6 months old, and the consideration of fine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clinical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To avoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated. This approach has been shown to be safe and identifies the vast majority of patients with non-Wilms tumors who are at risk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative chemotherapy.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Furthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity, including identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The centralized review process of histology, undertaken in the SIOP-RTSG, has shown that identification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and clinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be improved by considering the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA protocol.

The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry.  This includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  Patients registered in the UMBRELLA protocol will continue to be stratified for postoperative treatment according to tumour stage and histological risk group, as was the protocol in SIOP-2001. Prospective data from patients who are stratified and treated based on standardized recommendations will be collected and analyzed. This data collection, in combination with the results of planned integrated biomarker and imaging studies (which will assess the relative contribution of gain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), might be used to guide stratification in future protocols.  The therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial has been adopted as the new standard management regimen for most patients in the UMBRELLA protocol with stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. This schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on overall survival compared with 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m² (the standard arm) in the SIOP-2001 trial.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Post hoc analysis of data from SIOP-2001 was carried out to examine the association between omitting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with large-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a volume >500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prognosis, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumours (n=429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients with large-volume tumours had an estimated 5-year EFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume tumours (log rank P=0.01). Most importantly, EFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, log rank P=0.0005) when doxorubicin was added to the treatment regimen for large-volume (≥500 ml) tumours. Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (≥500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.  Furthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue treatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the regimen used in SIOP-2001. A comparison of the results of the SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials showed that in SIOP-2001, in which treatment was intensified by changing to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule for patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS increased from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006) avoiding intensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number of patients.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Overall, ~17% of patients with Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at diagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are by far the most frequently observed. The increasing use of chest CT as routine imaging for staging has resulted in the detection of small pulmonary nodules.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT

**Figure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial. Association of tumour volume with a) event-free survival (EFS) and b) overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier curves.**

(a) shows a Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating the association between tumor volume and event-free survival (EFS).  The 60-month EFS for tumors <500 ml is 90.3% (95% CI: 87.1-93.5), while for tumors ≥500 ml it's 80.0% (95% CI: 70.5-90.8). The hazard ratio (HR) is 2.38 (95% CI: 1.26-4.51), with a log-rank P-value of 0.01.

(b) presents a similar Kaplan-Meier curve analyzing the relationship between tumor volume and overall survival (OS). The 60-month OS for tumors <500 ml is 96.7% (95% CI: 94.6-98.8), and for tumors ≥500 ml it is 93.1% (95% CI: 86.8-99.9).  The HR is 2.51 (95% CI: 0.87-7.24), with a log-rank P-value of 0.08.  Both graphs include tables showing the number of patients at various time points, categorized by tumor volume.  CT-only nodules, not visible on chest radiography, are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases if their transverse diameter is at least 3mm, aligning with the COG and UMBRELLA protocols. The presence of these CT-only nodules correlated with increased relapse risk and decreased survival.  Studies (COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5) demonstrated that patients with CT-only nodules treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS compared to those receiving vincristine and actinomycin D only; however, overall survival was comparable between the groups.

</chunk>
<chunk>

Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease benefits patients with intermediate or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response. These patients avoid pulmonary radiotherapy, reducing the risk of long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications, or secondary malignancies.

Preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol mirrors SIOP-2001, employing a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks.  Following reassessment imaging (MRI for local tumor and CT/MRI for metastatic sites), surgery is performed.  This preoperative regimen achieves a 61-67% complete metastatic response rate before surgery.  Postoperative chemotherapy guidelines are detailed, notably reducing the cumulative doxorubicin dose to mitigate cardiac toxicity.  The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m² in SIOP-2001.  Preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggests that a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m² is sufficient for patients with favorable histology, without significantly impacting survival.  The UMBRELLA protocol, therefore, stratifies patients into three groups based on cumulative doxorubicin dosage (150 mg/m², 250 mg/m², or a four-drug regimen with 300 mg/m² of doxorubicin).  Stratification also considers the local stage of the primary tumor, histology (primary and metastatic tumors), size of metastatic lesions, and response to preoperative treatment and surgery.

</chunk>
<chunk>

Patients with metastatic disease and high-risk histological characteristics form a rare subgroup with a poor prognosis.  The UMBRELLA protocol recommends that local centers discuss the best treatment approach with the principal investigator for stage IV disease.  The SIOP-RTSG board currently suggests a regimen (based on unpublished COG data) involving vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (at the treating physician's discretion). The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy remains debated, although several groups have reported favorable outcomes in primary and relapsed settings. Details of this suggested regimen are included in the UMBRELLA protocol's appendix.  Data on its use and outcomes will be prospectively collected in the SIOP database for future descriptive analysis.

Figure 3 shows a post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumors in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.  The association of tumor volume and treatment with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) is presented using Kaplan-Meier curves.  AV-2 refers to actinomycin D, vincristine (27 weeks), and AVD refers to actinomycin D, vincristine, and doxorubicin.  The data shows survival probabilities at 60 months for various combinations of treatment and tumor volume (AVD <500ml, AV-2 <500ml, AVD 500+ml, AV-2 500+ml).  Log-rank P-values indicate the statistical significance of differences in survival between groups.  Tables present the number of patients at risk at different time points for each treatment group.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors (stage V) account for approximately 5-8% of Wilms tumor cases.  Long-term overall survival is currently around 80%.  However, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a significant morbidity, often caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations or treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue.  Studies have shown that nephron-sparing surgery leads to better functional renal outcomes compared to other surgical approaches. Children with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations are at increased risk of ESRD.  Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol advises against total nephrectomy for bilateral tumors at initial surgery. Other causes of ESRD include tumor recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation.  Long-term monitoring of renal function is essential after treatment for bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine and actinomycin D) until nephron-sparing surgery was feasible, with response evaluations every 4 weeks. However, prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective, especially for chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtypes, and may even increase the risk of anaplasia, disease progression, and metastasis.  The UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with 6-week intervals for evaluation.  This approach is designed to be comparable to the COG approach in future studies.  Misdiagnosis of synchronous bilateral renal tumors other than Wilms tumors is extremely rare.  In cases of non-responsiveness or inoperability, switching to etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, avoiding anthracyclines; biopsy may be performed to determine histology.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for treating relapsed Wilms tumors.  Prognostic factors include initial histology and first-line treatment.  Patients with relapsed tumors are prospectively classified into three groups (AA, BB, CC) based on these factors.  Group AA includes patients with initial stage I-II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumors who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment.  Treatment for group AA involves a four-drug combination (doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). This combination has been tested in the UKW-R and NWTS-5 relapse protocols, although drug combinations and doses varied. Group BB includes patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology who have already received doxorubicin.  Their treatment is an intensive reinduction regimen (etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by high-dose melphalan.

<chunk>
Table 2 provides a treatment overview for stage IV Wilms tumor (WT) based on response to treatment and histology.  The table is structured around metastasis surgery, Wilms tumor histology, and the corresponding treatment.  For patients with complete remission or very good partial remission after surgical complete resection, the treatment depends on the risk level (low or intermediate) and the presence and size of lung nodules.  Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease with lung nodules 3-5mm might receive AVD150 treatment without pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis is achieved, followed by pulmonary radiotherapy. If lung nodules are larger than 5mm, or located elsewhere, AVD250 is used with the same condition for pulmonary radiotherapy. Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease without evidence of metastasis receives treatment as localized disease.

For patients with partial response or stable disease, the treatment further stratifies based on whether a representative nodule resection is feasible.  Feasible resection for low-risk disease with viable metastasis confirmed might receive AVD250, with lung or metastasis radiotherapy, and a CT scan at week 10 to assess if remaining nodules require surgery for complete response. Similar strategies involving AVD150 or four-drug regimens are outlined based on risk, the presence of viable or necrotic metastasis and the feasibility of resection. If resection is not feasible, treatments vary depending on the risk level and presence of metastasis, utilizing AVD250, four-drug regimens, and radiotherapy as needed. For progressive disease, the approach is dictated by the presence of confirmed metastasis and the risk level, typically involving four-drug regimens and radiotherapy, followed by CT scans and potential surgical interventions.  High-risk disease calls for advice from a principal investigator, typically focusing on radiotherapy and potential resection.  Finally, if metastatic disease is confirmed by histology, treatment is determined based on the worst histology and response observed.  The table references a specific protocol (UMBRELLA-SIOP-RTSG-2016) and lists abbreviations for various drug regimens.

<chunk>
The accompanying text discusses the results of the UMBRELLA-SIOP-RTSG-2016 protocol and its implications for treating relapsed Wilms tumor.  The protocol incorporates autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) or additional reinduction courses. While acceptable response rates have been observed with various chemotherapy combinations, the use of ifosfamide, although effective, carries a risk of nephrotoxicity.  Consequently, cyclophosphamide is to be alternated with ifosfamide to mitigate this risk. The heterogeneous settings and results of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR have prompted a flexible approach to the consolidation phase, allowing the treating physician to determine the best strategy. This flexible approach is intended to be studied prospectively.  Relapsed cases (Group CC), particularly those involving diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors, are addressed using camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or other novel compounds, as these patients often have already received conventional treatments.  The SIOP-RTSG is committed to furthering research into new drug development for childhood cancers. Notably, local treatment strategies such as radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses are not yet extensively explored.
</chunk>


<chunk>
The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at relapse.  These guidelines include considering resection after proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemotherapy, regardless of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery seems possible or when evaluating histological tumor response is useful.  Applying radiotherapy to initially non-irradiated sites is uniformly accepted, but developing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites is difficult due to varying situations.  The UMBRELLA protocol recommends contacting radiotherapists on the SIOP-RTSG panel for these instances.

Infants (under 6 months) are considered for primary surgery unless tumors are deemed unsuitable for immediate nephrectomy by a multidisciplinary team.  This is because a higher proportion of infant renal tumors are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, requiring surgery alone or intensive chemotherapy, respectively. Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy is similar for infants and older children, adjusting drug doses based on age and weight.

Adult Wilms tumors are addressed with comprehensive UMBRELLA guidelines, acknowledging the long treatment delays and poor outcomes experienced by adults. Diagnosis in adults is exceptional, with treatment based on literature review and consensus, often diagnosed unexpectedly after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma. Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if Wilms tumor is histologically proven before surgery.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk in adults.  Treatment delays in adults necessitate individualized treatment regimens, differing from the pediatric approach.
</chunk>

<chunk>
The treatment regimen for pediatric stage I disease (actinomycin D and vincristine) is only advised for selected adult stage I patients without anaplasia. Other adults receive more intensive treatment; vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for nonanaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors. Exceptions are made for favorable histology stage II tumors with timely diagnosis allowing chemotherapy to start within 14 days of surgery. Vincristine dose intensity is lower for adults due to higher frequency of severe neurological toxicities.

Surgical recommendations for children with Wilms tumor involve radical tumor nephrectomy after preoperative chemotherapy, emphasizing lymph node sampling (seven locoregional lymph nodes for accurate staging).  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors meeting specific criteria in the UMBRELLA protocol: small tumor volume (<300ml), substantial remaining kidney function, and no lymph node involvement.  A new NSS classification system was adopted to optimize outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess NSS feasibility and minimize the risk of upstaging from incomplete resection.

Where possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.

In SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.

Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.

The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.

## Consensus Statement: International Collaboration in Wilms Tumour Treatment

The UMBRELLA protocol represents a significant advancement in the treatment of Wilms tumour, a pediatric renal cancer.  This international collaborative effort, involving over 50 countries in Europe and beyond, is the largest SIOP (International Society of Pediatric Oncology) renal tumour protocol to date.  Its scale enables the conduct of large-scale international research, addressing the existing geographic disparities in childhood cancer survival rates across Europe.  While survival rates for Wilms tumour are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG (SIOP Renal Tumour Study Group) aims to standardize diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment across various regions.  The protocol is particularly crucial for approximately 300 cases in Europe annually involving complex renal tumours that require multidisciplinary discussions and the expertise of specialized centers.


These complex cases often include bilateral Wilms tumours, those with extensive intravascular tumour thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumours.  Patients with such complexities will greatly benefit from the international collaboration facilitated by the UMBRELLA protocol, which provides access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy, and guidance for phase I/II trials.  The collaboration is further enhanced by initiatives such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net), an online consultation platform that identifies national reference centres and supports the establishment of international tumour boards, funding for coordinators, IT infrastructure, and future outreach to lower-income countries.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The UMBRELLA protocol serves a dual purpose: it provides a valuable guideline for routine clinical practice and simultaneously stimulates international collaboration and research. The standardized treatment approach for all Wilms tumour types, combined with the prospective collection of data from a large, homogenous patient cohort, will facilitate future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and identification of therapeutic targets.  Its status as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard will make it the backbone for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials.  Continuing collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) remains crucial.


The global collaboration spearheaded by the UMBRELLA protocol is particularly important for tackling the most challenging cases of Wilms tumour, namely, refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease. The protocol's contribution to addressing these complex situations is significant, potentially leading to improved outcomes for these patients.  The establishment of a robust international collaborative network ensures continued progress in research and treatment strategies.
