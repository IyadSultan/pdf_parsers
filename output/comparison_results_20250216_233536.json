The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP\u22122001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations (FIG. 1). The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately 5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma, are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours and will be available on the SIOP\u2013RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after its launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.\n\n1.

          "content": "**Consensus Statement on the Treatment of Wilms Tumours in the UMBRELLA Protocol**\n\nThis Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for the treatment of Wilms tumours within the UMBRELLA protocol. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for:\n\n- Localized disease\n- Metastatic disease (stage IV)\n- Bilateral disease\n- All age groups\n- Relapsed disease\n\nThese recommendations were established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic research. Thorough communications were undertaken with colleagues possessing similar expertise in the Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG) to ensure that all relevant evidence was applied when deciding how to implement the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial. This trial investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in the treatment of stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours and aimed to refine recommendations for patients with Wilms tumour. Over the past 15 years, extensive discussions on global strategies for children with renal tumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops. These conversations have resulted in the sharing of data and knowledge, which has informed the design of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment.\n\n### Treatment Recommendations\n\nIn general, the treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to the patient based on tumour stage and histology. It typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and, in some cases, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol commenced in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced for the majority of patients with Wilms tumours, leading to a survival rate of approximately 90% (2,6\u201310). Consequently, the identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors has become increasingly important to improve the stratification of patients according to their individual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consisting of only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine (11). Other patients, including those with metastatic disease and high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to benefit from doxorubicin (12\u201316). Moreover, as innovative techniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures continue to improve.\n\n#### Localized Disease\n\nSimilar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, the UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients newly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656 months. This recommendation is based on results from previous SIOP trials that demonstrated tumour downstaging using this regimen (2,6,8,9,14,17). This benefit was also independently observed in the randomized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, previously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study Group) (18). In patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could be reduced by 20% compared to those treated with direct nephrectomy, with no significant difference in survival (18).\n\nThe SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of misdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children under 6 months old. Additionally, the consideration of fine-needle biopsy is advised for patients who present with unusual clinical features or atypical findings on imaging. To avoid treatment delays, routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated. This approach has been shown to be safe and effectively identifies the vast majority of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at risk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables personalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, including the identification of high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumours. The centralized review process of histology undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG has demonstrated that the identification of the blastemal subtype is both feasible and clinically relevant. However, the definition of blastemal-type histology may be improved by considering the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA protocol (19).\n\n### Author Addresses\n\n1.

Prospective data from patients who are stratified and treated based on standardized recommendations will be collected and analyzed. This data collection, in combination with the results of planned integrated biomarker and imaging studies (which will assess the relative contribution of gain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), might be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\n\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm of the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new standard management regimen for most patients in the UMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. This schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on overall survival compared with 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m\u00b2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u22122001 trial.\n\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was carried out to examine the association between omitting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with large-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a volume >500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prognosis, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only stage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumours (n = 429). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with large-volume tumours had an estimated 5-year EFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume tumours (log rank P = 0.01) (FIG. 2). Most importantly, EFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, log rank P = 0.0005) when doxorubicin was added to the treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500 ml) tumours (FIG. 3). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (\u2265500 ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue treatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the regimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results of the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that in SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by changing to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule for patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS increased from 67% to 80% (log rank P = 0.006), avoiding intensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number of patients.\n\n**Metastatic Disease (Stage IV)**  \nOverall, approximately 17% of patients with Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at diagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are by far the most frequently observed. The increasing use of chest CT as routine imaging for staging has resulted in the detection of small pulmonary nodules.\n\n**Figure 1** | The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo.

The presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP\u2013RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions to those with true localized disease. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS compared to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only; however, overall survival was similar in both groups. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and therefore have a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications, or secondary malignancies.\n\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of the local tumor (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients have a complete metastatic response before surgery. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m\u00b2 in SIOP\u22122001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2 for patients with favorable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2, vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 250 mg/m\u00b2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150 mg/m\u00b2/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m\u00b2/day), cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m\u00b2/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m\u00b2). Stratification is based on the local stage of the primary tumor, histology of the primary tumor and the metastatic tumor (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).\n\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup with recognized unfavorable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centers discuss the best current treatment approach with the principal investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favorable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database",

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumors and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. \n\nAronson et al. (reference 35) observed that functional renal outcomes were considerably better after bilateral nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) compared to other types of surgery. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations are at increased risk of ESRD (reference 36). Therefore, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol (reference 35). \n\nHowever, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumor recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. \n\nSeveral studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective, especially since many bilateral tumors are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype, and could even result in an increased risk of anaplasia, disease progression, and metastases (references 31, 32, 34). Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with evaluation intervals fixed at 6 weeks to align with the COG approach for future studies. \n\nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, where synchronous bilateral renal tumors other than Wilms tumors are present, is extremely rare based on experience. In instances of tumor nonresponsiveness or inoperability, switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended to avoid the use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.\n\n**Relapsed Wilms Tumor:**\nThe UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumors. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used (references 37\u201339). Thus, patients with relapsed tumors will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol: group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors.\n\n**Treatment of Group AA Relapsed Wilms Tumors:**\nGroup AA includes patients with initial stage I\u2212II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumors who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment. Treatment will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). This combination has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW\u2011R protocol and the NWTS\u20115 relapse protocol, although drug combinations and doses varied (references 40, 41).\n\nPatients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan.\n\n---\n\nThis enhanced text maintains the original information and structure while correcting errors and improving clarity.",

Acceptable response rates have been observed with both cyclophosphamide and etoposide, as well as carboplatin and etoposide combinations; however, ifosfamide showed an increased response rate in early-phase trials^42. In an effort to reduce the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide in the group BB protocol recommendations. The heterogeneous settings in which the role of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR has been explored, along with the inconclusive results reported, led us to propose a flexible approach to the consolidation phase. High-dose chemotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician, aiming to describe the results in a prospective observational fashion^28.\n\nThe relapsed group CC includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For patients in this category, and for other relapsing patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol advises trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, as these patients will have already received most conventional active agents in their first-line therapy and are likely to develop chemotherapy-resistant disease^43. In the UMBRELLA protocol, the SIOP\u2013RTSG commits to endorse initiatives dedicated to new drug development in children, such as those launched by the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.\n\nImportantly, approaches to local treatment (including radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses) have not been systematically explored.\n\n**Table 2 | Treatment overview for stage IV WT based on response to treatment and histology***\n\n| Metastasis surgery | Wilms tumor histology | Treatment |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Complete remission or very good partial remission | Surgical complete resection if needed | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules 3\u20135 mm: AVD150, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy |\n| Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules >5 mm or other site | AVD250, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy | - Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease <br> - No evidence of metastasis: Treatment as localized |\n| Partial response or stable disease | Representative nodule resection feasible | - Low-risk disease <br> - Viable metastasis confirmed: AVD250, lung or metastasis radiotherapy, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible |\n| - Low-risk disease <br> - Completely necrotic metastasis | AVD150, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible | - Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease <br> - No evidence of viable tumor: Contact principal investigator\u2021, potentially treatment as localized or AVD250, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible, no radiotherapy to metastases |\n| - Intermediate-risk disease <br> - Viable metastasis confirmed | Four-drug regimen, radiotherapy to metastasis.

These guidelines include considering resection after proven reduction of relapsed disease following chemotherapy, regardless of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery seems possible or when it is useful to evaluate histological tumor response. Applying radiotherapy to initially non-irradiated sites is uniformly accepted; however, developing standard recommendations for the approach to previously irradiated sites is challenging due to the many different situations encountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends contacting radiotherapists on the SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\n\n**Infant Wilms Tumors**  \nInfants, defined as patients younger than 6 months (182 days), should be considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol, unless tumors are judged not amenable to immediate nephrectomy based on a multidisciplinary team consensus. The reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared with older children, a higher proportion of renal tumors in infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors that either require surgery alone (congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemotherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than actinomycin D and vincristine). Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants is similar to that in older children who underwent direct nephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according to age and body weight based on the experience from previous SIOP studies.\n\n**Adult Wilms Tumors**  \nThe UMBRELLA protocol registers and provides comprehensive guidelines for the management of adults with Wilms tumors, recognizing the long treatment delays and associated poor outcomes experienced by adult patients in the past. The diagnosis of Wilms tumor in adults is exceptional, and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and broad international and multidisciplinary consensus, as published in 2011. Adult Wilms tumor is often diagnosed unexpectedly after nephrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare instances where the diagnosis of Wilms tumor is histologically proven before surgery, preoperative chemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment strategies for Wilms tumor diagnosed in childhood. \n\nIn contrast to the histological classification of childhood Wilms tumors, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no evidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have better outcomes. Adult patients often experience considerable delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy, owing to the time needed to verify histology. For this reason, postoperative treatment recommendations for children cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For instance, the treatment regimen for pediatric stage I disease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised for a selected group of adult stage I patients without anaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more intensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with non-anaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors of any stage. Exceptions can be made in individual instances where the diagnosis of a stage II Wilms tumor with favorable histology is timely, and postoperative chemotherapy can start within 14 days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose intensity is decreased in guidelines for the treatment of adult Wilms tumors compared with standard guidelines for children, as adults more frequently develop severe neurological toxicities.\n\n**Surgical Recommendations**  \nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumor nephrectomy is the standard of care for children with Wilms tumor. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies surgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for the purpose of accurate staging.\n\nNephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors under certain conditions specified in the UMBRELLA protocol, which include small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of substantial remnant kidney function in patients with tumors <300 ml who have never had lymph node involvement. A new classification system for NSS, developed by a group of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, was adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to optimize comparison of patient outcomes (TABLE 3). For bilateral Wilms tumors, discussion with the SIOP\u2212RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging by incomplete resection of the tumor.\n\n**Table 3 | Classification of Nephron-Sparing Surgery Aspect**  \n| Description | Surgical Technique |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| NSS (A) = Partial Nephrectomy | Resection of tumor with a rim of normal renal parenchyma |\n| NSS (B) = Enucleation | Resection of tumor without a rim of normal renal parenchyma |\n\n| Surgical Resection Margin (SRM) | |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Intact pseudo-capsule | (0) |\n| Doubt | (1) |\n| Tumor breach | (2) |\n\n| Pathological Resection Margin (PRM) | |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Safe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except nephroblastomatosis | (0) |\n| Intact pseudocapsule along the resection margin | (1) |\n| Tumor breach | (2) |\n\n| Remaining Renal Parenchyma (RRP) | |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|\n| A subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage of renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney | = (n %) |\n| For example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP of 70%. |\n\n*NSS, nephron-sparing surgery*  \n*A classification for each case would be reported as follows: NSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).*  \n*Adapted from Godzinski, J. et al.

Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol. Although not advocated due to a lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be performed in patients in whom nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) can be safely conducted.\n\n**Radiotherapy Recommendations**\n\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and prior COG\u2013NWTS trials (TABLE 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al., unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to align with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78%, respectively) for favourable-histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs.\n\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.\n\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy, with or without surgery, do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year event-free survival (EFS) 84%, 5-year overall survival (OS) 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of <40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcomes with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients who are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n\n**Table 5 | Radiotherapy Guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for Metastatic Disease**\n\n| Disease Risk       | Lung (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Liver (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Brain (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Bone (total/fraction dose) |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Low-risk           | no                                        | no                                           | no                                            | no                          |\n| Intermediate-risk  | 12.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10\u201313 Gy)*                | 14.4/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                  | 30.6/1.8 Gy                 |\n| High-risk          | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 15\u201320 Gy)*                | 19.8/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*                | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                  | 30.6/1.8 Gy                 |\n\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\n\n**Table 4 | Radiotherapy Guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for Locoregional Disease**\n\n| Stage                     | Low-risk (total/fraction dose) | Intermediate-risk (total/fraction dose) | High-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumour (total/fraction dose) | High-risk diffuse anaplasia (total/fraction dose) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Stage I                   | no                              | no                                      | no                                                        | no                                                |\n| Stage II                  | no                              | no                                      | no                                                        | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                     |\n| Stage III                 | no                              | 14.4/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*          | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                             | 19.5/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                     |\n| Stage III (major rupture) | no                              | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7          | no                                                        | 19.5/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                     |\n\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.  \n\u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen.  \n\u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple residual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy).\n\n---\n\nThis enhanced text maintains the original information and structure while correcting any errors and ensuring clarity.",

In Europe alone, about 1,000 instances of pediatric renal tumors are diagnosed each year. In general, survival is excellent, but the SIOP\u2013RTSG aims to address the current geographic inequalities in childhood cancer survival by providing a standardized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. \n\nFurthermore, estimates suggest that approximately 300 instances of complex renal tumors in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treatment with clinicians at centers of expertise. Examples include most instances of bilateral Wilms tumors, patients with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors. Patients with these diseases could benefit from international collaboration to access specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials. \n\nEuropean initiatives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim to enhance such collaboration. The EXPO\u2011R\u2011Net is an online consultation platform for which national reference centers have been identified (FIG. 4), and this platform should contribute to the establishment of international tumor boards, funding for coordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future outreach to low-income countries.\n\n### Conclusions\nAs well as providing a useful guideline for routine clinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should stimulate international collaboration and research. By standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumor types, prospectively collected data from a large, homogeneous cohort of patients will be available for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and therapeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA protocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available treatment standard. It will be the backbone for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration with the COG will continue to be sought. Global collaboration is still necessary for finding effective treatments for the most unfavorable Wilms tumors, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA protocol will contribute to this aim.\n\n### Figure 4\nCentres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment.\n\n### References\n1.

This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.\n\nThe Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.\n</chunk>\n\n\n\n<chunk>\nThis Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol offers treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups. These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the incorporation of all relevant evidence, particularly from the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating intermediate-risk stage II-III Wilms tumors.  Over the past 15 years, extensive discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops have refined recommendations and shaped global strategies for children with renal tumors.  The sharing of data and knowledge from these collaborations directly influenced the design of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnosis and treatment.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nTreatment for Wilms tumors is tailored to individual patients, considering tumor stage and histology.  Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has decreased significantly, resulting in a 90% survival rate.  However, identifying additional predictive and prognostic factors remains crucial to improve patient stratification based on individual risk. Currently, approximately two-thirds of patients receive chemotherapy with only two drugs: actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from the addition of doxorubicin.  Surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are continuously improving with the advancement of innovative techniques.  For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol mirrors the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommending preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients over 6 months old, a practice supported by previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).  This approach, shown to effectively downstage tumors, reduces the need for radiotherapy or doxorubicin in patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, with no significant impact on survival.  The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosing Wilms tumors, recommending direct surgery for children under 6 months or fine-needle biopsy for those with atypical clinical presentations or imaging findings.  Routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated to avoid delays. This strategy successfully identifies most non-Wilms tumors, preventing unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nPreoperative chemotherapy allows for a personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity, particularly in identifying high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors. The centralized histology review process within the SIOP-RTSG has demonstrated the feasibility and clinical relevance of identifying this subtype.  However, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be enhanced by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, a factor that will be further investigated within the UMBRELLA protocol.\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo signifies a comprehensive effort to collect information on all pediatric primary renal tumors.  This includes diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  The protocol stratifies patients for postoperative treatment based on tumor stage and histological risk group, mirroring the SIOP-2001 protocol.  Data will be collected and analyzed, incorporating biomarker and imaging studies to potentially refine future stratification. The experimental arm's therapeutic regimen from the SIOP-2001 trial\u201427 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin\u2014has been adopted as the standard for most stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors in the UMBRELLA protocol.  This regimen, while showing a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) compared to the standard arm in SIOP-2001, had no effect on overall survival.\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nPost-hoc analysis of SIOP-2001 data examined the impact of omitting doxorubicin on patients with large-volume tumors (>500ml after preoperative chemotherapy).  Stromal and epithelial tumors were excluded, focusing on stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors.  The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in 5-year EFS between large-volume (80%) and small-volume (90%) tumors (log-rank P=0.01). Critically, adding doxorubicin to the treatment regimen for large-volume tumors significantly improved EFS (93% vs 67%, log-rank P=0.0005). Consequently, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends including doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with large-volume (\u2265500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors.  Treatment for blastemal-type tumors will continue to follow the SIOP-2001 regimen. A comparison of SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials highlighted that intensifying treatment for high-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumors increased EFS from 67% to 80% (log-rank P=0.006), while significantly reducing the need for relapse treatment.\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nApproximately 17% of Wilms tumor patients present with stage IV metastatic disease at diagnosis. This is defined as hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most common. Increased use of chest CT scans for staging has led to the detection of smaller pulmonary nodules.\n\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Disease</th>\n    <th>Tumour volume after preoperative chemotherapy</th>\n    <th>Stage I</th>\n    <th>Stage II</th>\n    <th>Stage III</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Low-risk</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>None</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, all subtypes</td>\n    <td>&lt;500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, stromal or epithelial-type</td>\n    <td>\u2265500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial</td>\n    <td>\u2265500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>High-risk blastemal type Wilms tumour</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>High-risk diffuse anaplasia</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nA, actinomycin D; D, doxorubicin; HR-1: etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (34 weeks); V, vincristine\n\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n\n**Figure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial. Association of tumour volume with (a) event-free survival (EFS) and (b) overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier curves.**\n\n(a) shows a Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating the association between tumor volume and event-free survival (EFS).  The 60-month EFS for tumors <500ml is 90.3% (95% CI: 87.1-93.5), while for tumors \u2265500ml it is 80.0% (95% CI: 70.5-90.8). The hazard ratio (HR) is 2.38 (95% CI: 1.26-4.51), with a log-rank P-value of 0.01.\n\n(b) shows a Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating the association between tumor volume and overall survival (OS). The 60-month OS for tumors <500ml is 96.7% (95% CI: 94.6-98.8), while for tumors \u2265500ml it is 93.1% (95% CI: 86.8-99.9). The hazard ratio (HR) is 2.51 (95% CI: 0.87-7.24), with a log-rank P-value of 0.08.  Both graphs include tables showing the number of patients at each time point for both tumor volume categories.\n\nCT-only nodules, not visible on chest radiography, are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in both the COG and UMBRELLA protocols if their transverse diameter is at least 3 mm.  The presence of these CT-only nodules is associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival.  Studies have shown that patients with CT-only nodules treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS compared to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, although overall survival was similar between the groups.  Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease benefits patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response.  These patients don't require pulmonary radiotherapy, reducing the risk of long-term sequelae.\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nSimilar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local and metastatic sites before surgery. With this regimen, 61-67% of patients have a complete metastatic response before surgery.  Detailed guidelines are provided for postoperative chemotherapy stratification, with the cumulative doxorubicin dose lowered to reduce cardiac toxicity.  In SIOP-2001, the cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m\u00b2.  Preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggests that a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2 for patients with favorable histology doesn't significantly affect survival. Therefore, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to one of three regimens: vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (150 mg/m\u00b2 cumulative dose), vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (250 mg/m\u00b2 cumulative dose), or a four-drug regimen (etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin).  Stratification is based on the local stage of the primary tumor, histology of the primary and metastatic tumors, size of metastatic lesions, and response to preoperative treatment and surgery.\n\nPatients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination represent a rare subgroup with a poor prognosis.  The UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centers discuss the best treatment approach with the principal investigator for stage IV disease.  The SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen (based on unpublished data) including vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is debated, but favorable outcomes have been reported. Details of this regimen are in the UMBRELLA protocol's appendix. Data on its use and outcomes will be captured in the SIOP database for future evaluation.\n\n\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nFigure 3 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.

AV-2, actinomycin D, vincristine (27 weeks); AVD, actinomycin D, vincristine and doxorubicin.\n\nBilateral disease (stage V). Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of Wilms tumour and long-term overall survival is currently ~80%. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et al. observed that functional renal outcome was considerably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of ESRD. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol. However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies. The occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nRelapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used<sup>1\u20133</sup>. Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors. Treatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I\u2013II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours, who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW-R protocol and the NWTS-5 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied<sup>4,5</sup>.

Acceptable response rates have been observed with both cyclophosphamide and etoposide and carboplatin and etoposide combinations, but ifosfamide showed an increased response rate in early-phase trials.  To reduce the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide. The heterogeneous settings in which the role of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR has been explored and the inconclusive results reported led to a proposed flexible approach to the consolidation phase, with high-dose chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician.  The aim is to describe the results in a prospective observational fashion.\n\nRelapsed group CC includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For patients in this category, and for other relapsing patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol advises trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, as these patients will have already received most conventional active agents in their first-line therapy and are likely to develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. The SIOP-RTSG commits to endorse initiatives dedicated to new drug development in children, such as those launched by the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.\n\nImportantly, approaches to local treatment (including radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses) have not been systematically explored.\n\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at relapse.  These guidelines include considering resection after proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemotherapy, irrespective of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery seems possible or when evaluating histological tumor response is useful. Applying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites is uniformly accepted, but developing standard recommendations for the approach to previously irradiated sites is challenging due to the variability of situations encountered.  For these instances, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends contacting radiotherapists on the SIOP-RTSG panel.\n\nInfants (younger than 6 months or 182 days) should be considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol unless tumors are deemed inoperable by a multidisciplinary team.  Upfront nephrectomy is preferred for infants because a higher proportion of renal tumors in this age group are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors, which either require surgery alone or alternative chemotherapy. Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants is similar to that in older children, adjusting drug doses according to age and body weight based on previous SIOP studies.\n\nAdult Wilms tumors are managed according to comprehensive UMBRELLA guidelines, acknowledging the long treatment delays and associated poor outcomes.  Diagnosis in adults is exceptional, and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and multidisciplinary consensus. Adult Wilms tumor is often unexpectedly diagnosed after nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if the diagnosis of Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as there is no evidence suggesting that patients with focal anaplasia have better outcomes. Adults often experience significant delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time needed for histological verification.  Therefore, pediatric treatment regimens cannot be directly applied to adults.  For example, the pediatric stage I regimen of actinomycin D and vincristine is only recommended for a select group of adult stage I patients without anaplasia.  Other adults receive more intensive treatment, varying based on the presence or absence of anaplasia.</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical nephrectomy is the standard of care for children with Wilms tumor. The UMBRELLA protocol emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, aiming to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for accurate staging.  Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors under specific conditions outlined in the UMBRELLA protocol, including small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of substantial remnant kidney function in patients with tumors <300 ml and no lymph node involvement.  A new classification system for NSS, developed by SIOP-RTSG surgeons and pathologists, optimizes outcome comparison within the UMBRELLA protocol.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging from incomplete resection.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Aspect*</th>\n      <th>Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Surgical technique</td>\n      <td>\u2022 NSS (A) \u2013 Partial Nephrectomy \u2013 resection of tumor with a rim of normal renal parenchyma<br>\u2022 NSS (B) \u2013 Enucleation \u2013 resection of tumor without a rim of normal renal parenchyma</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Surgical resection margin (SRM)</td>\n      <td>\u2022 Intact pseudo-capsule \u2013 (0)<br>\u2022 Doubt \u2013 (1)<br>\u2022 Tumor breach \u2013 (2)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Pathological resection margin (PRM)</td>\n      <td>\u2022 Safe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except nephroblastomatosis \u2013 (0)<br>\u2022 Intact pseudo-capsule along the resection margin \u2013 (1)<br>\u2022 Tumor breach \u2013 (2)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Remaining renal parenchyma (RRP)</td>\n      <td>\u2022 A subjective evaluation done by the surgeon of the percentage of renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney \u2013 (n%)<br>\u2022 For example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP of 70%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nWhere possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.\n\nIn SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (TABLE 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs. Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%)<sup>1</sup>. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs<sup>2</sup>. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology<sup>3</sup>.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed<sup>4</sup>. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol<sup>5</sup>.\n\n</chunk>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Table 4 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease</th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Stage I<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Stage II<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Stage III<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Stage III (major rupture)\u2021<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low-risk</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermediate-risk</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>14.4/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>15.0/1.5 Cy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumour</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>19.5/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u2021</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-risk diffuse anaplasia</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>19.5/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u2021</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple residual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Table 5 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 for metastatic disease</th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Lung<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Liver<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Brain<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n<td>Bone<br>(total/fraction dose)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low-risk</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>no</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermediate-risk</td>\n<td>12.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10\u201313 Gy)*</td>\n<td>14.4/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>15.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>30.6/1.8 Gy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-risk</td>\n<td>15.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 15\u201320Gy)*</td>\n<td>19.8/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n<td>30.6/1.8 Gy</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only</p>\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA protocol will guide the treatment of Wilms tumors in over 50 countries across Europe and beyond.  This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumor protocol published to date, facilitating significant international research. In Europe alone, approximately 1000 pediatric renal tumors are diagnosed annually. While overall survival rates are excellent, the SIOP-RTSG aims to address geographical disparities in childhood cancer survival by implementing standardized approaches to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  Estimates suggest that around 300 cases of complex renal tumors in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussions with experts at specialized centers. These cases include most instances of bilateral Wilms tumors, patients with extensive intravascular tumor thrombus or complex metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumors.  International collaboration will be crucial for these patients, providing access to specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials.\n\nEuropean initiatives, such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net) aim to enhance this collaboration.  The ExPO-R-Net is an online platform connecting national reference centers (Figure 4), contributing to the establishment of international tumor boards, securing funding for coordinators and IT infrastructure, and facilitating future outreach to lower-income countries.  The preliminary European surgical expert referral sites include: University Hospital of Munich, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Azienda Ospedaliera, Padova, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9, Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Prinses Maxima Centrum, Utrecht, Marciniak Hospital, Wroclaw, Faculty of Medicine, Gdansk, St. Anna Kinderspital/CCRI, Vienna, Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paris, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. The overall subnetwork coordination centers include: University Hospital Homburg, Princes Maxima Centrum, Utrecht, L'Institut d'H\u00e9matologie et d'Oncologie P\u00e9diatrique de Lyon, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA protocol serves a dual purpose: it provides a valuable guideline for routine clinical practice and stimulates international collaboration and research. By standardizing treatment for all Wilms tumor types, it allows for the prospective collection of data from a large, homogenous patient cohort. This data will be invaluable for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and the identification of therapeutic targets.  The UMBRELLA protocol will serve as the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard, forming the foundation for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials. Ongoing collaboration with the COG will be essential.  However, global collaboration remains crucial for finding effective treatments for the most challenging cases of Wilms tumors, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease.  The UMBRELLA protocol aims to significantly contribute to progress in these areas.\n</chunk>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Country</th>\n<th>Institution and location</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Germany</td>\n<td>University Hospital of Munich, Munich</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Germany</td>\n<td>University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td>Azienda Ospedaliera, Padova</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td>Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9, Rome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Netherlands</td>\n<td>Prinses Maxima Centrum, Utrecht</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poland</td>\n<td>Marciniak Hospital, Wroclaw</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poland</td>\n<td>Faculty of Medicine, Gdansk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Austria</td>\n<td>St. Anna Kinderspital/CCRI, Vienna</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>France</td>\n<td>Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paris</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spain</td>\n<td>Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spain</td>\n<td>Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UK</td>\n<td>Great Ormond Street Hospital, London</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<chunk>\n6.

        "to register renal tumour patients. This Consensus \nStatement focuses on the rationale for treatment of \nWilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nTreatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the \nUMBRELLA protocol include recommendations \nfor localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral dis\u00ad\nease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. \nThese recom\u00admendations were established by a multi\u00ad\ndisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours \nwithin the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncolo\u00ad\ngists, radio\u00adlogists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation \noncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic \nresearch. Thorough communications were undertaken \nwith colleagues with similar expertise involved in the \nChildren\u2019s Oncology Group (COG), to ensure all rele\u00ad\nvant evidence was applied when deciding how to imple\u00ad\nment the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial, \nwhich investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in \ntreating stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours, \nand to refine recommendations for patients with \nWilms tumour. Over the past 15\u00a0years, wide-ranging \ndiscussions on global strategies for children with renal \ntumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG \nduring meetings and workshops. These conversations \nhave resulted in sharing of data and knowledge, which \nhas been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA \nguideline for diagnostics and treatment.\nTreatment recommendations\nIn general, treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to \nthe patient based on tumour stage and histology, and \ninvolves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, \nand, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP \nprotocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been \nsuccessfully reduced for the majority of patients with \nWilms tumours, and survival has risen to 90%2,6\u201310. \nConsequently, the identification of additional predic\u00ad\ntive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to \nimprove the stratification of patients according to their \nindividual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients \nwith Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consist\u00ad\ning of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vin\u00adcristine11. \nOther patients, including those with metastatic disease \nand high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to \nbenefit from doxorubicin12\u201316. Moreover, as inno\u00advative \ntechniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic \nprocedures are improving.\nLocalized disease. Similar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, \nthe UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend \npreoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients \nnewly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656\u00a0months, \nbased on results of previous SIOP trials that showed \ntumour downstaging using this regimen2,6,8,9,14,17. This \nbenefit was also independently observed in the random\u00ad\nized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK \nChildren\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, \npreviously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study \nGroup)18. In patients receiving preoperative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could \nbe reduced by 20% compared with those treated with \ndirect nephrectomy, with no significant difference in \nsurvival18. The SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of \nmisdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending \ndirect surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy \nfor children <6\u00a0months old, and the consideration of \nfine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clin\u00ad\nical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To \navoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment \nbefore treatment is not advocated. This approach has \nbeen shown to be safe and identifies the vast major\u00ad\nity of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at \nrisk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative \nchemotherapy.\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables \npersonalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, \nincluding identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type \nWilms tumours. The centralized review process of histo\u00ad\nlogy, undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG, has shown that \nidentification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and \nclinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type \nhistology might be improved by considering the abso\u00ad\nlute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative \npercentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol19.\nAuthor addresses\n1Department of Paediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology, \nLundlaan 6, 3584EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n2Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, 30 Guilford \nSt, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.\n3Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066\u2009CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n4Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, Saarland University, Kirrberger Str. \n100, 66421, Homburg, Germany.\n5Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, La Timone Children\u2019s Hospital, 264 \nRue Saint-Pierre, 13385, Marseille, France.\n6Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff University \nSchool of Medicine, Heath Park, Eastern Ave, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom.\n7Kiel Paediatric Tumour Registry, Department of Paediatric Pathology, University Hospital \nof Kiel, Christian-Albrechts-Platz 4, 24118, Kiel, Germany.\n8Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of the Saarland, Kirrberger Str. 100, \n66421, Homburg, Germany.\n9Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, \n1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n10Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, \nHeidelberglaan 100, 3584\u2009CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n11Department of Paediatric Surgery, Marciniak Hospital, Fieldorfa 2, 54\u2013049, \nWroclaw, Poland.\n12Department of Paediatric Traumatology and Emergency Medicine, Medical University, \nWybrzeze Ludwika Pasteura 1, 50\u2013367, Wroclaw, Poland.\n13Department of Paediatric Oncology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo, \nAv.

Prospective \ndata from patients who are stratified and treated based \non standardized recommendations will be collected and \nanalysed. This data collection, in combination with the \nresults of planned integrated biomarker and imaging \nstudies (which will assess the relative contribution of \ngain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), \nmight be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm \nof the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new \nstandard management regimen for most patients in the \nUMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2212III intermediate-risk \nWilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27\u00a0weeks of \nvincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. \nThis schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease \nin event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on \noverall survival compared with 27\u00a0weeks of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at \n50\u2009mg/m2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u20112001 trial2.\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was car\u00ad\nried out to examine the association between omit\u00ad\nting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with \nlarge-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a vol\u00ad\nume >500\u2009ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal \nand epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prog\u00ad\nnosis20, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only \nstage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type \ntumours (n\u2009=\u2009429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients \nwith large-volume tumours had an estimated 5\u2011year \nEFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume \ntumours (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.01) (FIG.\u00a02). Most importantly, \nEFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, \nlog rank P\u2009=\u20090.0005) when doxorubicin was added to \nthe treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500\u2009ml) \ntumours (FIG.\u00a03). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in \npost\u00adoperative treatment of patients with large-\u00advolume \n(\u2265500\u2009ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial \ntumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue \ntreatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the \nregimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results \nof the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that \nin SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by \nchanging to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule \nfor patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS \nincreased from 67% to 80% (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.006) avoiding \nintensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number \nof patients12.\nMetastatic disease (stage IV). Overall, ~17% of patients \nwith Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at \ndiagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous meta\u00ad\nstases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdom\u00ad\ninal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are \nby far the most frequently observed21\u201323.

Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor \nStudy Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed \nthat patients with CT\u2011only nodules who were treated \nwith vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin \nhad superior EFS to those who received vincristine and \nactinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in \nboth groups25. Including CT\u2011only nodules in the defi\u00ad\nnition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with \nintermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve \na rapid complete response of their CT\u2011only nodules. \nThese patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy \nand have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term \nsequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or \nsecondary malignancies.\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for \nmetastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, \nand doxo\u00adrubicin regimen for 6\u00a0weeks, followed by reas\u00ad\nsessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and \nmetastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. \nWith this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients \nhave complete metastatic response before surgery21,23. \nDetailed guidelines are provided for the stratification \nof postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumu\u00ad\nlative dose of doxo\u00adrubicin has been lowered in order to \nreduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose \nfor patients with metastatic disease was 300\u2009mg/m2 in \nSIOP\u22122001, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 \ntrial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2 for patients with favourable histo\u00ad\nlogy does not considerably affect survival25,26. For this \nreason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends strati\u00ad\nfying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin \nD plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxo\u00adrubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2, vincristine, and actinomycin D \nplus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of \n250\u2009mg/m2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide \n(150\u2009mg/m2/day), carboplatin (200\u2009mg/m2/day), cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide (450\u2009mg/m2/day), and doxorubicin (cumu\u00ad\nlative dose 300\u2009mg/m2). Stratification is based on local \nstage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary \ntumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size \nof metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative \ntreatment and surgery (TABLE\u00a02).\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-\nrisk characteristics on histological examination are a \nrare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prog\u00adnosis. \nOnly a few patients per year will be stratified into this \ncategory. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local \ncentres discuss the best current treatment approach \nwith the principle investigator for stage IV disease. \nCurrently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen \nbased on unpublished but presented data from the COG27, \nincluding combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, \nfollowed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem \ncell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physi\u00ad\ncian. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this \nsubgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable \noutcomes has been reported by several groups in the pri\u00ad\nmary and relapsed settings28\u201330. Details of this suggested \nregimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA \nprotocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes \nwill be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and \ncan, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\nFigure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

Synchronous bilateral Wilms \ntumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of \nWilms tumour and long-term overall survival is cur\u00ad\nrently ~80%31\u201335. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the \nmost clinically significant morbidity for patients with \nbilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by under\u00ad\nlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-\u00ad\nrelated loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et\u00a0al.35 \nobserved that functional renal outcome was consider\u00ad\nably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery \n(NSS) than when other types of surgery were used35. \nIndependently of the type of treatment, children with \nWilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and \nretardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes \nassociated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of \nESRD36. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial sur\u00ad\ngery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol35. However, other important causes of ESRD \nexist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral \nnephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term moni\u00ad\ntoring of renal function is required after treatment of \nbilateral disease. In the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with \nbilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy \nincluding vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS \nwas deemed feasible, with response evaluations per\u00ad\nformed every 4\u00a0weeks. However, several studies have \nshown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is \noften ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours \nare the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and \ncould even result in an increased risk of the presence \nof anaplasia, disease progression, and development of \nmetastases31,32,34. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits \npreoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12\u00a0weeks, \nwith time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6\u00a0weeks, to be \ncomparable with the COG approach for future studies. \nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous \nbilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are \npresent, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances \nof tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching \nto treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recom\u00ad\nmended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can \nbe considered to determine histology.\nRelapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol \nprovides structured guidelines for the treatment of \npatients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective \nstudies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology \nand the first-line treatment used37\u201339. Thus, patients with \nrelapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into \nthree groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, \ngroup BB, and group CC, based on these factors.\nTreatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, \ndefined as patients with initial stage I\u2212II low-risk or \nintermediate-risk tumours, who received only vin\u00ad\ncristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in \ntheir first-line treatment, will include four drugs (com\u00ad\nbinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and \ncarboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these \ndrugs has already been tested in two comprehensive \nstudies, the UKW\u2011R protocol and the NWTS\u20115 relapse \nprotocol, but drug combinations and doses varied40,41.\nPatients without initial diffuse anaplasia or \nblastemal-\u00adtype histology, who have already received \ndoxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classi\u00ad\nfied as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction \ndrug regimen (including the combination of etopo\u00ad\nside and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan \nFigure 3 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

        "so the UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guide\u00ad\nlines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at \nrelapse. These guidelines include considering resection \nafter proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, independently of histological subtype or risk \ngroup, when radical surgery seems possible or when \nit is useful to evaluate histological tumour response. \nApplying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites \nis uniformly accepted, but developing standard recom\u00ad\nmendations for the approach to previously irradiated \nsites is difficult, because of the many different situations \nencountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA \nproto\u00adcol recommends contacting radiotherapists on \nthe SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\nInfant Wilms tumours. Infants, defined as patients \nyounger than 6\u00a0months (182\u00a0days), should be considered \nfor primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol, unless tumours are judged not amenable to immed\u00ad\niate nephrectomy in a multidisciplinary team consensus. \nThe reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared \nwith older children, a higher proportion of renal tumours \nin infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malig\u00ad\nnant rhabdoid tumours that either need surgery alone \n(congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than \nactinomycin D and vincristine)44,45. Percutaneous cutting \nneedle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV \ndisease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. \nPostoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumour is similar \nin infants to that in older children who underwent direct \nnephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according \nto age and body weight based on the experience from \nprevious SIOP studies44.\nAdult Wilms tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol reg\u00ad\nisters and provides comprehensive guidelines for the \nmanagement of adults with Wilms tumours, recog\u00ad\nnizing the long treatment delays and associated poor \noutcomes experienced by adult patients in the past46\u201349. \nThe diagnosis of Wilms tumour in adults is exceptional \nand treatment recommendations are based on literature \nreview and broad international and multi\u00addisciplinary \nconsensus, as published in 2011 (REF.\u00a046). Adult Wilms \ntumour is often diagnosed unexpectedly after neph\u00ad\nrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare \ninstances in which the diagnosis of Wilms tumour \nis histologically proven before surgery, preoperative \nchemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment \nstrategies for Wilms tumour diagnosed in childhood. \nIn contrast to the histological classification of child\u00ad\nhood Wilms tumours, both focal and diffuse ana\u00adplasia \nare considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no \nevidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have \nbetter outcomes50.\nAdult patients often experience considerable delays \nbefore starting postoperative chemotherapy, owing to \nthe time needed to verify histology46\u201349. For this reason, \npostoperative treatment recommendations for chil\u00ad\ndren cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For \ninstance, the treatment regimen for paediatric stage I \ndisease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised \nfor a selected group of adult stage I patients without \nanaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more \nintensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with \nnonanaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for \nanaplastic tumours of any stage. Exceptions can be \nmade in individual instances, in which diagnosis of \na stage II Wilms tumour with favourable histology is \ntimely and postoperative chemotherapy can start within \n14\u00a0days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose inten\u00ad\nsity is decreased in guidelines for treatment of adult \nWilms tumours compared with standard guidelines for \nchildren, as adults more frequently develop severe \nneurological toxicities48.\nSurgical recommendations\nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumour \nnephrectomy is the standard of care for children with \nWilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies \nsurgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of \nlymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to \nsample seven locoregional lymph nodes, for the purpose \nof accurate staging51\u201353.\nNSS is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral \nWilms tumours under certain conditions, specified in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol, that include small tumour \nvolume (<300\u2009ml) and the expectation of a substantial \nremnant kidney function in patients with tumours \n<300\u2009ml who never had lymph node involvement52. \nA new classification system for NSS, developed by a \ngroup of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, \nwas adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to opti\u00ad\nmize comparison of patient outcomes54 (TABLE\u00a03). For \nbi\u00adlateral Wilms tumours, discussion with the SIOP\u2212\nRTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended, in order \nto assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk \nof upstaging by incomplete resection of the tumour. \nTable 3 | Classification of nephron-sparing\nAspect*\nDescription\nSurgical \ntechnique\n\u2022\tNSS (A)\u2009=\u2009Partial Nephrectomy\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour with a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\n\u2022\tNSS (B)\u2009=\u2009Enucleation\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour without a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\nSurgical \nresection \nmargin (SRM)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudo-capsule\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tDoubt\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nPathological \nresection \nmargin (PRM)\n\u2022\tSafe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except \nnephroblastomatosis\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudocapsule along the resection margin\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nRemaining renal \nparenchyma \n(RRP)\n\u2022\tA subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage \nof renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney\u2009=\u2009(n %)\n\u2022\tFor example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP \nof 70%.\nNSS, nephron-sparing surgery *A classification for each case would be reported as follows: \nNSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).

        "Where possible, surgery should be performed in iden\u00ad\ntified reference centres. Issues related to minimally \ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, \nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these \ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, \nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non\u00ad\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node \nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery \nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be \nsafely performed.\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms \ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or \nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio\u00ad\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based \non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and \nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55 (TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost \ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III \nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data \nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was \nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu\u00ad\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung \nirradiation was decreased from 15\u2009Gy to 12\u2009Gy in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS \nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall \nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\u00ad\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, \nactinomycin\u2011D, vincristine, and 12\u2009Gy to the lungs13.\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for \nintermediate-\u00adrisk or high-risk histology tumours \nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery) \npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or \nmacro\u00adscopic peritoneal deposits.\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for \nlung metastases lacking complete response by post\u00ad\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority \nof patients achieving a complete response after induc\u00ad\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need \nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival \neven without radiotherapy (5\u2011year EFS 84%, 5\u2011year OS \n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso\u00adciated with poor \nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio\u00ad\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with \nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence \nin the lung, whole-lung ir\u00adradiation is recommended for \npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during \nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults \nand children with Wilms tumours, with the exception \nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi\u00ad\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II \nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not \nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in \nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes \nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of \nradiotherapy be discussed.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed \ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that \nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if \nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther\u00ad\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours \nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and \nneeds further investigation before implementation in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\nTable 5 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for metastatic disease\nLung\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nLiver\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBrain\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBone\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\n12.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10\u201313\u2009Gy)*\n14.4/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\nHigh-risk\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 15\u201320\u2009Gy)*\n19.8/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\nTable 4 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\nStage I\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage II\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III (major rupture)\u2021\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\nno\nno\n14.41.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7\nHigh-risk blastemal-\ntype Wilms tumour\nno\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\nHigh-risk diffuse \nanaplasia\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple \nresidual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n750 | DECEMBER 2017 | VOLUME 14\t\nwww.nature.com/nrurol\n\u00a9\n 2\n0\n1\n7\n M\na\nc\nm\ni\nl\nl\na\nn\n P\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nr\ns\n L\ni\nm\ni\nt\ne\nd\n,\n p\na\nr\nt\n o\nf\n S\np\nr\ni\nn\ng\ne\nr\n N\na\nt\nu\nr\ne\n.\n A\nl\nl\n r\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n r\ne\ns\ne\nr\nv\ne\nd\n.",

In gen\u00ad\neral, survival is excellent, but the SIOP\u2013RTSG aims \nto address the current geographic inequalities in \nchildhood cancer survival by providing a standard\u00ad\nized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and \ntreatment. Furthermore, estimates suggest that ~300 \ninstances of complex renal tumours in Europe would \nbenefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treat\u00ad\nment with clinicians at centres of expertise5. Examples \ninclude most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, \npatients with extensive intravascular tumour throm\u00ad\nbus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced dif\u00ad\nfuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these \ndiseases could benefit from international collabora\u00ad\ntion to access specialized surgical techniques, cardio\u00ad\nthoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, \nand guidance for phase\u00a0I/II trials. European initia\u00ad\ntives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology \nReference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment \n(ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim \nto enhance such collaboration. The EXPO\u2011R\u2011Net is \nan online consultation platform for which national \nreference centres have been identified (FIG.\u00a04), and \nthis platform should contribute to the establish\u00ad\nment of international tumour boards, funding for \nco\u00adordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future \noutreach to low-income countries.\nConclusions\nAs well as providing a useful guideline for routine \nclinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should \nstimulate international collaboration and research. \nBy standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumour \ntypes, prospectively collected data from a large, homo\u00ad\ngenous cohort of patients will be available for future \nvali\u00addation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, \nand thera\u00adpeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA \nprotocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available \ntreatment standard. It will be the backbone \nfor new treatment approaches in future phase\u00a0\nI/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration \nwith the COG will continue to be sought. Global \ncollaboration is still necessary for finding effec\u00ad\ntive treatments for the most unfavourable Wilms \ntumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, \nand relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA \nprotocol will contribute to this aim.\nFigure 4 | Centres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference \nNetwork for Diagnostics and Treatment.\n1.\t\nSIOP Renal Tumour Study Group.

The UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol will support integrated biomarker and imaging \nresearch, with a particular focus on assessing the inde\u00ad\npendent prognostic value of genomic changes within \nthe tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent \nof its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of \nthe blastemal component that survives preoperative \nchemotherapy3,4.\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively un\u00adcommon, \naccounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. \nOf these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to \nbe Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours \n(non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma \nof the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhab\u00ad\ndoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic \nnephroma are even less common5. The exact incidence \nof non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the prob\u00ad\nable under-registration of patients with these tumours \nin renal tumour protocols.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms \ntumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available \non the SIOP\u2013RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after \nlaunch in 2017.

        "to register renal tumour patients. This Consensus \nStatement focuses on the rationale for treatment of \nWilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nTreatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the \nUMBRELLA protocol include recommendations \nfor localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral dis\u00ad\nease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. \nThese recom\u00admendations were established by a multi\u00ad\ndisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours \nwithin the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncolo\u00ad\ngists, radio\u00adlogists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation \noncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic \nresearch. Thorough communications were undertaken \nwith colleagues with similar expertise involved in the \nChildren\u2019s Oncology Group (COG), to ensure all rele\u00ad\nvant evidence was applied when deciding how to imple\u00ad\nment the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial, \nwhich investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in \ntreating stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours, \nand to refine recommendations for patients with \nWilms tumour. Over the past 15\u00a0years, wide-ranging \ndiscussions on global strategies for children with renal \ntumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG \nduring meetings and workshops. These conversations \nhave resulted in sharing of data and knowledge, which \nhas been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA \nguideline for diagnostics and treatment.\nTreatment recommendations\nIn general, treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to \nthe patient based on tumour stage and histology, and \ninvolves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, \nand, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP \nprotocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been \nsuccessfully reduced for the majority of patients with \nWilms tumours, and survival has risen to 90%2,6\u201310. \nConsequently, the identification of additional predic\u00ad\ntive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to \nimprove the stratification of patients according to their \nindividual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients \nwith Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consist\u00ad\ning of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vin\u00adcristine11. \nOther patients, including those with metastatic disease \nand high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to \nbenefit from doxorubicin12\u201316. Moreover, as inno\u00advative \ntechniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic \nprocedures are improving.\nLocalized disease. Similar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, \nthe UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend \npreoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients \nnewly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656\u00a0months, \nbased on results of previous SIOP trials that showed \ntumour downstaging using this regimen2,6,8,9,14,17. This \nbenefit was also independently observed in the random\u00ad\nized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK \nChildren\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, \npreviously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study \nGroup)18. In patients receiving preoperative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could \nbe reduced by 20% compared with those treated with \ndirect nephrectomy, with no significant difference in \nsurvival18. The SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of \nmisdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending \ndirect surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy \nfor children <6\u00a0months old, and the consideration of \nfine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clin\u00ad\nical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To \navoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment \nbefore treatment is not advocated. This approach has \nbeen shown to be safe and identifies the vast major\u00ad\nity of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at \nrisk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative \nchemotherapy.\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables \npersonalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, \nincluding identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type \nWilms tumours. The centralized review process of histo\u00ad\nlogy, undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG, has shown that \nidentification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and \nclinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type \nhistology might be improved by considering the abso\u00ad\nlute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative \npercentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol19.\nAuthor addresses\n1Department of Paediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology, \nLundlaan 6, 3584EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n2Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, 30 Guilford \nSt, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.\n3Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066\u2009CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n4Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, Saarland University, Kirrberger Str. \n100, 66421, Homburg, Germany.\n5Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, La Timone Children\u2019s Hospital, 264 \nRue Saint-Pierre, 13385, Marseille, France.\n6Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff University \nSchool of Medicine, Heath Park, Eastern Ave, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom.\n7Kiel Paediatric Tumour Registry, Department of Paediatric Pathology, University Hospital \nof Kiel, Christian-Albrechts-Platz 4, 24118, Kiel, Germany.\n8Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of the Saarland, Kirrberger Str. 100, \n66421, Homburg, Germany.\n9Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, \n1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n10Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, \nHeidelberglaan 100, 3584\u2009CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n11Department of Paediatric Surgery, Marciniak Hospital, Fieldorfa 2, 54\u2013049, \nWroclaw, Poland.\n12Department of Paediatric Traumatology and Emergency Medicine, Medical University, \nWybrzeze Ludwika Pasteura 1, 50\u2013367, Wroclaw, Poland.\n13Department of Paediatric Oncology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo, \nAv.

Prospective \ndata from patients who are stratified and treated based \non standardized recommendations will be collected and \nanalysed. This data collection, in combination with the \nresults of planned integrated biomarker and imaging \nstudies (which will assess the relative contribution of \ngain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), \nmight be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm \nof the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new \nstandard management regimen for most patients in the \nUMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2212III intermediate-risk \nWilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27\u00a0weeks of \nvincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. \nThis schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease \nin event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on \noverall survival compared with 27\u00a0weeks of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at \n50\u2009mg/m2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u20112001 trial2.\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was car\u00ad\nried out to examine the association between omit\u00ad\nting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with \nlarge-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a vol\u00ad\nume >500\u2009ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal \nand epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prog\u00ad\nnosis20, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only \nstage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type \ntumours (n\u2009=\u2009429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients \nwith large-volume tumours had an estimated 5\u2011year \nEFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume \ntumours (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.01) (FIG.\u00a02). Most importantly, \nEFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, \nlog rank P\u2009=\u20090.0005) when doxorubicin was added to \nthe treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500\u2009ml) \ntumours (FIG.\u00a03). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in \npost\u00adoperative treatment of patients with large-\u00advolume \n(\u2265500\u2009ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial \ntumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue \ntreatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the \nregimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results \nof the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that \nin SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by \nchanging to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule \nfor patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS \nincreased from 67% to 80% (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.006) avoiding \nintensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number \nof patients12.\nMetastatic disease (stage IV). Overall, ~17% of patients \nwith Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at \ndiagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous meta\u00ad\nstases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdom\u00ad\ninal lymph node metastases.

Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor \nStudy Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed \nthat patients with CT\u2011only nodules who were treated \nwith vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin \nhad superior EFS to those who received vincristine and \nactinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in \nboth groups25. Including CT\u2011only nodules in the defi\u00ad\nnition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with \nintermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve \na rapid complete response of their CT\u2011only nodules. \nThese patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy \nand have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term \nsequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or \nsecondary malignancies.\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for \nmetastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, \nand doxo\u00adrubicin regimen for 6\u00a0weeks, followed by reas\u00ad\nsessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and \nmetastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. \nWith this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients \nhave complete metastatic response before surgery21,23. \nDetailed guidelines are provided for the stratification \nof postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumu\u00ad\nlative dose of doxo\u00adrubicin has been lowered in order to \nreduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose \nfor patients with metastatic disease was 300\u2009mg/m2 in \nSIOP\u22122001, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 \ntrial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2 for patients with favourable histo\u00ad\nlogy does not considerably affect survival25,26. For this \nreason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends strati\u00ad\nfying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin \nD plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxo\u00adrubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2, vincristine, and actinomycin D \nplus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of \n250\u2009mg/m2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide \n(150\u2009mg/m2/day), carboplatin (200\u2009mg/m2/day), cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide (450\u2009mg/m2/day), and doxorubicin (cumu\u00ad\nlative dose 300\u2009mg/m2). Stratification is based on local \nstage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary \ntumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size \nof metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative \ntreatment and surgery (TABLE\u00a02).\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-\nrisk characteristics on histological examination are a \nrare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prog\u00adnosis. \nOnly a few patients per year will be stratified into this \ncategory. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local \ncentres discuss the best current treatment approach \nwith the principle investigator for stage IV disease. \nCurrently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen \nbased on unpublished but presented data from the COG27, \nincluding combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, \nfollowed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem \ncell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physi\u00ad\ncian. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this \nsubgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable \noutcomes has been reported by several groups in the pri\u00ad\nmary and relapsed settings28\u201330. Details of this suggested \nregimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA \nprotocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes \nwill be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and \ncan, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\nFigure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

Synchronous bilateral Wilms \ntumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of \nWilms tumour and long-term overall survival is cur\u00ad\nrently ~80%31\u201335. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the \nmost clinically significant morbidity for patients with \nbilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by under\u00ad\nlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-\u00ad\nrelated loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et\u00a0al.35 \nobserved that functional renal outcome was consider\u00ad\nably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery \n(NSS) than when other types of surgery were used35. \nIndependently of the type of treatment, children with \nWilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and \nretardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes \nassociated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of \nESRD36. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial sur\u00ad\ngery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol35. However, other important causes of ESRD \nexist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral \nnephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term moni\u00ad\ntoring of renal function is required after treatment of \nbilateral disease. In the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with \nbilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy \nincluding vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS \nwas deemed feasible, with response evaluations per\u00ad\nformed every 4\u00a0weeks. However, several studies have \nshown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is \noften ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours \nare the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and \ncould even result in an increased risk of the presence \nof anaplasia, disease progression, and development of \nmetastases31,32,34. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits \npreoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12\u00a0weeks, \nwith time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6\u00a0weeks, to be \ncomparable with the COG approach for future studies. \nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous \nbilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are \npresent, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances \nof tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching \nto treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recom\u00ad\nmended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can \nbe considered to determine histology.\nRelapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol \nprovides structured guidelines for the treatment of \npatients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective \nstudies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology \nand the first-line treatment used37\u201339. Thus, patients with \nrelapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into \nthree groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, \ngroup BB, and group CC, based on these factors.\nTreatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, \ndefined as patients with initial stage I\u2212II low-risk or \nintermediate-risk tumours, who received only vin\u00ad\ncristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in \ntheir first-line treatment, will include four drugs (com\u00ad\nbinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and \ncarboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these \ndrugs has already been tested in two comprehensive \nstudies, the UKW\u2011R protocol and the NWTS\u20115 relapse \nprotocol, but drug combinations and doses varied40,41.\nPatients without initial diffuse anaplasia or \nblastemal-\u00adtype histology, who have already received \ndoxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classi\u00ad\nfied as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction \ndrug regimen (including the combination of etopo\u00ad\nside and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan \nFigure 3 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

        "so the UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guide\u00ad\nlines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at \nrelapse. These guidelines include considering resection \nafter proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, independently of histological subtype or risk \ngroup, when radical surgery seems possible or when \nit is useful to evaluate histological tumour response. \nApplying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites \nis uniformly accepted, but developing standard recom\u00ad\nmendations for the approach to previously irradiated \nsites is difficult, because of the many different situations \nencountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA \nproto\u00adcol recommends contacting radiotherapists on \nthe SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\nInfant Wilms tumours. Infants, defined as patients \nyounger than 6\u00a0months (182\u00a0days), should be considered \nfor primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol, unless tumours are judged not amenable to immed\u00ad\niate nephrectomy in a multidisciplinary team consensus. \nThe reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared \nwith older children, a higher proportion of renal tumours \nin infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malig\u00ad\nnant rhabdoid tumours that either need surgery alone \n(congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than \nactinomycin D and vincristine)44,45. Percutaneous cutting \nneedle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV \ndisease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. \nPostoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumour is similar \nin infants to that in older children who underwent direct \nnephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according \nto age and body weight based on the experience from \nprevious SIOP studies44.\nAdult Wilms tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol reg\u00ad\nisters and provides comprehensive guidelines for the \nmanagement of adults with Wilms tumours, recog\u00ad\nnizing the long treatment delays and associated poor \noutcomes experienced by adult patients in the past46\u201349. \nThe diagnosis of Wilms tumour in adults is exceptional \nand treatment recommendations are based on literature \nreview and broad international and multi\u00addisciplinary \nconsensus, as published in 2011 (REF.\u00a046). Adult Wilms \ntumour is often diagnosed unexpectedly after neph\u00ad\nrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare \ninstances in which the diagnosis of Wilms tumour \nis histologically proven before surgery, preoperative \nchemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment \nstrategies for Wilms tumour diagnosed in childhood. \nIn contrast to the histological classification of child\u00ad\nhood Wilms tumours, both focal and diffuse ana\u00adplasia \nare considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no \nevidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have \nbetter outcomes50.\nAdult patients often experience considerable delays \nbefore starting postoperative chemotherapy, owing to \nthe time needed to verify histology46\u201349. For this reason, \npostoperative treatment recommendations for chil\u00ad\ndren cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For \ninstance, the treatment regimen for paediatric stage I \ndisease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised \nfor a selected group of adult stage I patients without \nanaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more \nintensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with \nnonanaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for \nanaplastic tumours of any stage. Exceptions can be \nmade in individual instances, in which diagnosis of \na stage II Wilms tumour with favourable histology is \ntimely and postoperative chemotherapy can start within \n14\u00a0days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose inten\u00ad\nsity is decreased in guidelines for treatment of adult \nWilms tumours compared with standard guidelines for \nchildren, as adults more frequently develop severe \nneurological toxicities48.\nSurgical recommendations\nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumour \nnephrectomy is the standard of care for children with \nWilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies \nsurgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of \nlymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to \nsample seven locoregional lymph nodes, for the purpose \nof accurate staging51\u201353.\nNSS is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral \nWilms tumours under certain conditions, specified in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol, that include small tumour \nvolume (<300\u2009ml) and the expectation of a substantial \nremnant kidney function in patients with tumours \n<300\u2009ml who never had lymph node involvement52. \nA new classification system for NSS, developed by a \ngroup of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, \nwas adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to opti\u00ad\nmize comparison of patient outcomes54 (TABLE\u00a03). For \nbi\u00adlateral Wilms tumours, discussion with the SIOP\u2212\nRTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended, in order \nto assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk \nof upstaging by incomplete resection of the tumour. \nTable 3 | Classification of nephron-sparing\nAspect*\nDescription\nSurgical \ntechnique\n\u2022\tNSS (A)\u2009=\u2009Partial Nephrectomy\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour with a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\n\u2022\tNSS (B)\u2009=\u2009Enucleation\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour without a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\nSurgical \nresection \nmargin (SRM)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudo-capsule\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tDoubt\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nPathological \nresection \nmargin (PRM)\n\u2022\tSafe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except \nnephroblastomatosis\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudocapsule along the resection margin\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nRemaining renal \nparenchyma \n(RRP)\n\u2022\tA subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage \nof renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney\u2009=\u2009(n %)\n\u2022\tFor example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP \nof 70%.\nNSS, nephron-sparing surgery *A classification for each case would be reported as follows: \nNSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).

        "Where possible, surgery should be performed in iden\u00ad\ntified reference centres. Issues related to minimally \ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, \nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these \ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, \nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non\u00ad\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node \nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery \nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be \nsafely performed.\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms \ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or \nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio\u00ad\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based \non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and \nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55 (TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost \ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III \nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data \nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was \nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu\u00ad\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung \nirradiation was decreased from 15\u2009Gy to 12\u2009Gy in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS \nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall \nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\u00ad\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, \nactinomycin\u2011D, vincristine, and 12\u2009Gy to the lungs13.\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for \nintermediate-\u00adrisk or high-risk histology tumours \nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery) \npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or \nmacro\u00adscopic peritoneal deposits.\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for \nlung metastases lacking complete response by post\u00ad\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority \nof patients achieving a complete response after induc\u00ad\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need \nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival \neven without radiotherapy (5\u2011year EFS 84%, 5\u2011year OS \n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso\u00adciated with poor \nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio\u00ad\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with \nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence \nin the lung, whole-lung ir\u00adradiation is recommended for \npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during \nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults \nand children with Wilms tumours, with the exception \nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi\u00ad\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II \nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not \nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in \nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes \nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of \nradiotherapy be discussed.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed \ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that \nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if \nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther\u00ad\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours \nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and \nneeds further investigation before implementation in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\nTable 5 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for metastatic disease\nLung\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nLiver\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBrain\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBone\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\n12.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10\u201313\u2009Gy)*\n14.4/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\nHigh-risk\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 15\u201320\u2009Gy)*\n19.8/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\nTable 4 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\nStage I\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage II\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III (major rupture)\u2021\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\nno\nno\n14.41.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7\nHigh-risk blastemal-\ntype Wilms tumour\nno\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\nHigh-risk diffuse \nanaplasia\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple \nresidual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n750 | DECEMBER 2017 | VOLUME 14\t\nwww.nature.com/nrurol\n\u00a9\n 2\n0\n1\n7\n M\na\nc\nm\ni\nl\nl\na\nn\n P\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nr\ns\n L\ni\nm\ni\nt\ne\nd\n,\n p\na\nr\nt\n o\nf\n S\np\nr\ni\nn\ng\ne\nr\n N\na\nt\nu\nr\ne\n.\n A\nl\nl\n r\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n r\ne\ns\ne\nr\nv\ne\nd\n.": {

In gen\u00ad\neral, survival is excellent, but the SIOP\u2013RTSG aims \nto address the current geographic inequalities in \nchildhood cancer survival by providing a standard\u00ad\nized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and \ntreatment. Furthermore, estimates suggest that ~300 \ninstances of complex renal tumours in Europe would \nbenefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treat\u00ad\nment with clinicians at centres of expertise5. Examples \ninclude most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, \npatients with extensive intravascular tumour throm\u00ad\nbus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced dif\u00ad\nfuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these \ndiseases could benefit from international collabora\u00ad\ntion to access specialized surgical techniques, cardio\u00ad\nthoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, \nand guidance for phase\u00a0I/II trials. European initia\u00ad\ntives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology \nReference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment \n(ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim \nto enhance such collaboration. The EXPO\u2011R\u2011Net is \nan online consultation platform for which national \nreference centres have been identified (FIG.\u00a04), and \nthis platform should contribute to the establish\u00ad\nment of international tumour boards, funding for \nco\u00adordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future \noutreach to low-income countries.\nConclusions\nAs well as providing a useful guideline for routine \nclinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should \nstimulate international collaboration and research. \nBy standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumour \ntypes, prospectively collected data from a large, homo\u00ad\ngenous cohort of patients will be available for future \nvali\u00addation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, \nand thera\u00adpeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA \nprotocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available \ntreatment standard. It will be the backbone \nfor new treatment approaches in future phase\u00a0\nI/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration \nwith the COG will continue to be sought. Global \ncollaboration is still necessary for finding effec\u00ad\ntive treatments for the most unfavourable Wilms \ntumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, \nand relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA \nprotocol will contribute to this aim.\nFigure 4 | Centres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference \nNetwork for Diagnostics and Treatment.\n1.\t\nSIOP Renal Tumour Study Group.

Issues related to minimally\ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the\nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated,\nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these\ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances,\nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non -\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node\nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery\nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be\nsafely performed.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms\ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or\nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio-\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based\non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and\nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55(TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost\ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III\nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA\nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data\nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was\nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu-\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung\nirradiation was decreased from 15  Gy to 12 Gy in the\nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS\nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall\nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin,\nactinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs13.\n               Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for\nintermediate- risk or high-risk histology tumours\nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery)\npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or\nmacro scopic peritoneal deposits.\n               Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for\nlung metastases lacking complete response by post-\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority\nof patients achieving a complete response after induc -\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need\nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival\neven without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS\n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso  ciated with poor\nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio -\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with\nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence\nin the lung, whole-lung ir  radiation is recommended for\npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during\nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\n               Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults\n\nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi-\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II\nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not\nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in\nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes\nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of\nradiotherapy be discussed.\n               The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed\ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that\nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if\nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther-\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours\nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and\nneeds further investigation before implementation in\nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\n\n                                                             Table 4| Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\n
