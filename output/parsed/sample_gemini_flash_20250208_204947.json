This protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, focussing on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic, and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations have been established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP-RTSG. The UMBRELLA protocol should promote international collaboration and research and serve as the SIOP-RTSG best available treatment standard.\n\nThe Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP-RTSG) has developed a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment of childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to continue international collaboration in the treatment of childhood renal tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP-2001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations. The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP-RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nThe Consensus Statement focuses on the rationale for treating Wilms tumors using the UMBRELLA protocol.  The UMBRELLA protocol provides treatment guidelines for localized, metastatic (stage IV), bilateral, and relapsed Wilms tumors across all age groups. These recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the SIOP-RTSG, including pediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and basic research scientists.  Extensive communication with colleagues from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) ensured the incorporation of all relevant evidence, particularly the findings of the SIOP-2001 randomized trial which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors. Over the past 15 years, collaborative discussions between SIOP-RTSG and COG have refined global strategies for treating children with renal tumors. This data sharing has influenced the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnosis and treatment.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nTreatment for Wilms tumors is personalized based on tumor stage and histology, typically involving a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol in 1971, treatment intensity has successfully decreased, increasing survival rates to 90%.  The identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors is crucial for improved patient stratification based on individual risk.  Currently, two-thirds of Wilms tumor patients receive chemotherapy using only actinomycin D and vincristine.  Patients with metastatic disease or high-risk histological subtypes may benefit from doxorubicin.  Ongoing improvements in surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are expected to further enhance treatment efficacy.  For localized disease, the UMBRELLA protocol, similar to the SIOP-2001 protocol, recommends preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients over 26 months old, based on results from previous SIOP trials and the UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG).  This preoperative regimen reduces the need for radiotherapy or doxorubicin by 20% without affecting survival.  The SIOP-RTSG acknowledges the risk of misdiagnosis by recommending direct surgery for children under 6 months old and considering fine-needle biopsy for those with unusual clinical presentations or imaging findings. Routine histological assessment before treatment is discouraged to avoid delays.  This approach has proven safe and identifies non-Wilms tumors, preventing unnecessary preoperative chemotherapy.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nPreoperative chemotherapy allows for personalized assessment of tumor chemosensitivity and identification of high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumors.  The SIOP-RTSG's centralized histology review has demonstrated the feasibility and clinical relevance of identifying this subtype. However, the definition of blastemal-type histology could be improved by focusing on the absolute residual volume of blastema instead of the relative percentage, a factor which will be further investigated in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all pediatric primary renal tumors in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations.  Patients registered in the UMBRELLA protocol will continue to be stratified for postoperative treatment according to tumor stage and histological risk group, as was the protocol in SIOP-2001 (Table 1). Prospective data from patients who are stratified and treated based on standardized recommendations will be collected and analyzed. This data collection, in combination with the results of planned integrated biomarker and imaging studies (which will assess the relative contribution of gain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), might be used to guide stratification in future protocols.  The therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm of the SIOP-2001 trial has been adopted as the new standard management regimen for most patients in the UMBRELLA protocol with stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms tumors. This regimen consists of 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. This schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on overall survival compared with 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m\u00b2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP-2001 trial.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP-2001 was carried out to examine the association between omitting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with large-volume tumors (defined as tumors with a volume &gt;500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumor types, which have excellent prognosis, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only stage II-III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumors (n=429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients with large-volume tumors had an estimated 5-year EFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume tumors (log rank P=0.01) (Fig. 2). Most importantly, EFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, log rank P=0.0005) when doxorubicin was added to the treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500 ml) tumors (Fig. 3). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (\u2265500 ml) stage II-III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumors is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol. Furthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue treatment for blastemal-type tumors according to the regimen used in SIOP-2001. A comparison of the results of the SIOP-2001 and SIOP-93-01 trials showed that in SIOP-2001, in which treatment was intensified by changing to the high-risk tumor treatment schedule for patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumor, EFS increased from 67% to 80% (log rank P=0.006) avoiding intensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number of patients.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nMetastatic disease (stage IV). Overall, ~17% of patients with Wilms tumors present with stage IV disease at diagnosis, which is defined as hematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are by far the most frequently observed. The increasing use of chest CT as routine imaging for staging has resulted in the detection of small pulmonary nodules.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Disease</th>\n    <th>Tumour volume after preoperative chemotherapy</th>\n    <th>Stage I</th>\n    <th>Stage II</th>\n    <th>Stage III</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Low-risk</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>None</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, all subtypes</td>\n    <td>&lt;500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, stromal or epithelial-type</td>\n    <td>\u2265500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AV (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial</td>\n    <td>\u2265500 ml</td>\n    <td>AV (4 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>High-risk blastemal type Wilms tumour</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>High-risk diffuse anaplasia</td>\n    <td>All</td>\n    <td>AVD (27 weeks)</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n    <td>HR-1 (34 weeks) + flank radiotherapy</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nA, actinomycin D; D, doxorubicin; HR-1 etoposide, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (34 weeks); V, vincristine\n\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n\nFigure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial. Association of tumour volume with (a) event-free survival (EFS) and (b) overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier curves.\n\nNot visible on chest radiography (CT-only nodules). Similar to the COG protocol, CT-only nodules are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm (REFS 22,24,25). Presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP-RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions with those with true localized disease<sup>1</sup>. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups<sup>2</sup>. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or secondary malignancies.\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nSimilar to SIOP-2001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61-67% of patients have complete metastatic response before surgery<sup>3</sup>. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered in order to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m\u00b2 in SIOP-2001, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2 for patients with favourable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2, vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of 250 mg/m\u00b2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150 mg/m\u00b2/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m\u00b2/day), cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m\u00b2/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m\u00b2). Stratification is based on local stage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary tumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centres discuss the best current treatment approach with the principle investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP-RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings<sup>3</sup>. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\n\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nFigure 3 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III, intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumour in the SIOP-2001 randomized controlled trial.

AV-2, actinomycin D, vincristine (27 weeks); AVD, actinomycin D, vincristine and doxorubicin.\n\nBilateral disease (stage V). Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of Wilms tumour and long-term overall survival is currently ~80%. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson *et al.* observed that functional renal outcome was considerably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. Independently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes associated with *WT1* mutations, are at increased risk of ESRD<sup>14</sup>. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol. However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease. In the SIOP-2001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy including vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies.\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.\n\nRelapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used<sup>15,16</sup>. Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors. Treatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I\u2013II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours, who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW-R protocol and the NWTS-5 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied<sup>17,18</sup>. Patients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan\n</chunk>\n\n<table></table>\n\n<chunk>\n## Consensus Statement: Treatment Overview for Stage IV WT\n\n**Table 2:** Treatment overview for stage IV WT based on response to treatment and histology*\n\n| Metastasis surgery | Wilms tumour histology | Treatment |\n|---|---|---|\n| Complete remission or very good partial remission | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules 3-5mm | AVD150, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy |\n|  | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules >5mm or other site | AVD250, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy |\n| Surgical complete resection if needed | \u2022 Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease <br> \u2022 No evidence of metastasis | Treatment as localized |\n| Partial response or stable disease |  |  |\n| Representative nodule resection feasible | \u2022 Low-risk disease <br> \u2022 Viable metastasis confirmed | AVD250, lung or metastasis radiotherapy, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible |\n|  | \u2022 Low-risk disease <br> \u2022 Completely necrotic metastasis | AVD150, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible |\n|  | \u2022 Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease <br> \u2022 No evidence of viable tumour | Contact principal investigator, potentially treatment as localized or AVD250, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible, no radiotherapy to metastases |\n|  | \u2022 Intermediate-risk disease <br> \u2022 Viable metastasis confirmed | Four-drug regimen, radiotherapy to metastasis.

In an effort to reduce the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide in the group BB protocol recommendations. The heterogeneous settings in which the role of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR has been explored and the inconclusive results reported led us to propose a flexible approach to the consolidation phase, and high-dose chemotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician, aiming to describe the results in a prospective observational fashion.\n\nRelapsed group CC includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumours. For patients in this category, and for the other relapsing patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol advises trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, as these patients will have already received most conventional active agents in their first-line therapy and are likely to develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. In the UMBRELLA protocol, the SIOP-RTSG commits to endorse initiatives dedicated to new drug development in children, such as those launched by the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.\n\nImportantly, approaches to local treatment (including radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumour masses) have not been systematically explored.\n\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nThe UMBRELLA protocol offers structured guidelines for radiotherapy and surgery administration at relapse.  These guidelines encompass considering resection after proven relapse disease reduction following chemotherapy, regardless of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery is feasible or when histological tumor response evaluation is beneficial.  While radiotherapy application to initially unirradiated sites is widely accepted, establishing standard recommendations for previously irradiated sites proves challenging due to the diversity of encountered situations.  In such cases, the UMBRELLA protocol advises consulting with radiotherapists from the SIOP-RTSG panel.\n\nInfants (under 6 months, or 182 days) are generally considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol unless immediate nephrectomy is deemed unsuitable by a multidisciplinary team.  This is because infants have a higher proportion of congenital mesoblastic nephromas or malignant rhabdoid tumors, which may only require surgery (in the case of mesoblastic nephromas) or may necessitate alternative, more intensive chemotherapy from the outset (for malignant rhabdoid tumors). Percutaneous needle biopsy is recommended for stage IV disease or when immediate surgery presents difficulties.  Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor in infants mirrors that of older children undergoing nephrectomy, with dosage adjustments based on age and weight, using data from previous SIOP studies.  The UMBRELLA protocol also provides comprehensive management guidelines for adults with Wilms tumors, acknowledging the long treatment delays and the resulting poor outcomes frequently observed in adult patients.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nThe diagnosis of Wilms tumor in adults is rare and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and international consensus, as outlined in a 2011 publication.  Adult Wilms tumor is often unexpectedly discovered following nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is recommended if Wilms tumor is histologically confirmed before surgery, mirroring childhood treatment strategies.  Unlike in children, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk factors in adults due to a lack of evidence suggesting better outcomes for patients with focal anaplasia.\n\nAdult patients frequently face substantial delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time needed for histology verification.  Therefore, pediatric treatment regimens cannot be directly applied.  For instance, the actinomycin D and vincristine regimen for pediatric stage I disease is only suitable for selected adult stage I patients lacking anaplasia. Other adult patients receive more intensive treatment, either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (for nonanaplastic subtypes) or a four-drug regimen (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors of any stage.  Exceptions might be made in cases where a stage II Wilms tumor with favorable histology is diagnosed promptly, enabling chemotherapy initiation within 14 days of surgery.  Vincristine dosage is lower in adult treatment guidelines compared to pediatric guidelines to mitigate the higher incidence of severe neurological toxicities in adults.\n</chunk>\n\n<chunk>\nFor children with Wilms tumor, the standard of care involves radical nephrectomy following preoperative chemotherapy. The UMBRELLA protocol highlights the importance of lymph node sampling, aiming to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for accurate staging. Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for certain nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors; criteria include small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of significant remaining renal function, particularly in patients with tumors under 300 ml who have not experienced lymph node involvement.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol adopted a new NSS classification system developed by SIOP-RTSG surgeons and pathologists to facilitate outcome comparisons.  For bilateral Wilms tumors, consultation with the SIOP-RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess NSS feasibility and minimize the risk of upstaging from incomplete tumor resection.  A table detailing the classification of nephron-sparing surgery is included, specifying surgical technique (partial nephrectomy with or without a rim of normal parenchyma, enucleation), surgical resection margin (intact pseudo-capsule, doubt, tumor breach), pathological resection margin (safe rim of renal parenchyma, intact pseudocapsule along resection margin, tumor breach), and the percentage of remaining renal parenchyma.\n</chunk>\n\n\n```html\n<chunk>\nWhere possible, surgery should be performed in identified reference centres. Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, owing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be done in patients in whom NSS can be safely performed.\n\nIn SIOP-2001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP-2001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP-2001 analysis and prior COG-NWTS trials (Table 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP-2001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al. unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs.\n</chunk>\n```\n\n```html\n<chunk>\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits. Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of &lt;40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed. The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n</chunk>\n```\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Stage I<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Stage II<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Stage III<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Stage III (major rupture)\u2021<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Low-risk</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Intermediate-risk</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>14.4/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>15.0/1.5 Cy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>High-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumour</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>19.5/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>High-risk diffuse anaplasia</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>19.5/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u2021</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple residual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)\n```\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Lung<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Liver<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Brain<br>(whole + boost)<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n      <th>Bone<br>(total/fraction dose)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Low-risk</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n      <td>no</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Intermediate-risk</td>\n      <td>12.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10-13 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>14.4/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>15.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>30.6/1.8 Gy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>High-risk</td>\n      <td>15.0/1.5 Gy<br>(\u00b1 15-20Gy)*</td>\n      <td>19.8/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>25.2/1.8 Gy<br>(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*</td>\n      <td>30.6/1.8 Gy</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only\n```\n\n<chunk>\n## Consensus Statement: International Collaboration in Wilms Tumour Treatment\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol represents a significant advancement in the treatment of Wilms tumour, guiding treatment across over 50 countries in Europe and beyond.  This makes it the largest collaborative SIOP renal tumour protocol to date, facilitating substantial international research.  In Europe alone, approximately 1000 cases of pediatric renal tumours are diagnosed annually. While survival rates are generally excellent, the SIOP-RTSG initiative aims to address geographical disparities in childhood cancer survival.  This is achieved through a standardized approach encompassing diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.  Estimates suggest that around 300 cases of complex renal tumours in Europe would benefit significantly from multidisciplinary discussions involving experts.  This includes cases of bilateral Wilms tumours, those with extensive intravascular tumour thrombus or complex metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumours.\n\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\n\nPatients with these complex presentations stand to gain immensely from international collaboration, accessing specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and participation in phase I/II clinical trials. European initiatives, such as the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO-R-Net), are actively promoting this collaboration. The ExPO-R-Net online platform serves as a central hub, facilitating communication between identified national reference centres. This platform is expected to contribute to the establishment of international tumour boards, secure funding for coordinators, develop robust IT infrastructure and logistics, and extend future support to low-income countries.\n\n</chunk>\n<chunk>\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol serves a dual purpose: it provides a practical guideline for routine clinical practice and stimulates international collaboration and research. By standardizing the treatment approach for all Wilms tumour types, a large, homogeneous dataset will be generated, enabling future validation of biomarkers, effective treatment stratification, and identification of therapeutic targets.  The protocol establishes the SIOP-RTSG best-available treatment standard and will serve as the foundation for future phase I/II trials and randomized controlled studies, fostering continued collaboration with the COG.  However, global collaboration remains crucial in addressing the challenges posed by the most challenging cases \u2013 refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk Wilms tumours.  The UMBRELLA protocol is designed to directly contribute to advancing treatment in these complex situations.\n\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Country</th>\n    <th>Institution and location</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Germany</td>\n    <td>University Hospital of Munich, Munich</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Germany</td>\n    <td>University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Italy</td>\n    <td>Azienda Ospedaliera, Padova</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Italy</td>\n    <td>Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9, Rome</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Italy</td>\n    <td>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Netherlands</td>\n    <td>Prinses Maxima Centrum, Utrecht</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Poland</td>\n    <td>Marciniak Hospital, Wroclaw</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Poland</td>\n    <td>Faculty of Medicine, Gdansk</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Austria</td>\n    <td>St. Anna Kinderspital/CCRI, Vienna</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>France</td>\n    <td>Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paris</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Spain</td>\n    <td>Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo, Seville</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Spain</td>\n    <td>Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>UK</td>\n    <td>Great Ormond Street Hospital, London</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</chunk>\n\n\n<chunk>\n6.

    "The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International \nSociety of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP\u2013RTSG) has \ndeveloped a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment \nof childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG \n2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to con\u00ad\ntinue international collaboration in the treatment of \nchildhood renal tumours1. The UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol succeeds the SIOP\u22122001 protocol2. The name \nUMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect \ninformation concerning all paediatric primary renal \ntumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data \nregistry, which includes embedded review of diag\u00ad\nnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment \nrecom\u00admendations1 (FIG.\u00a01). The UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol will support integrated biomarker and imaging \nresearch, with a particular focus on assessing the inde\u00ad\npendent prognostic value of genomic changes within \nthe tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent \nof its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of \nthe blastemal component that survives preoperative \nchemotherapy3,4.\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively un\u00adcommon, \naccounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. \nOf these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to \nbe Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours \n(non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma \nof the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhab\u00ad\ndoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic \nnephroma are even less common5. The exact incidence \nof non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the prob\u00ad\nable under-registration of patients with these tumours \nin renal tumour protocols.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms \ntumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available \non the SIOP\u2013RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after \nlaunch in 2017.

    "to register renal tumour patients. This Consensus \nStatement focuses on the rationale for treatment of \nWilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nTreatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the \nUMBRELLA protocol include recommendations \nfor localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral dis\u00ad\nease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. \nThese recom\u00admendations were established by a multi\u00ad\ndisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours \nwithin the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncolo\u00ad\ngists, radio\u00adlogists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation \noncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic \nresearch. Thorough communications were undertaken \nwith colleagues with similar expertise involved in the \nChildren\u2019s Oncology Group (COG), to ensure all rele\u00ad\nvant evidence was applied when deciding how to imple\u00ad\nment the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial, \nwhich investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in \ntreating stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours, \nand to refine recommendations for patients with \nWilms tumour. Over the past 15\u00a0years, wide-ranging \ndiscussions on global strategies for children with renal \ntumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG \nduring meetings and workshops. These conversations \nhave resulted in sharing of data and knowledge, which \nhas been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA \nguideline for diagnostics and treatment.\nTreatment recommendations\nIn general, treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to \nthe patient based on tumour stage and histology, and \ninvolves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, \nand, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP \nprotocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been \nsuccessfully reduced for the majority of patients with \nWilms tumours, and survival has risen to 90%2,6\u201310. \nConsequently, the identification of additional predic\u00ad\ntive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to \nimprove the stratification of patients according to their \nindividual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients \nwith Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consist\u00ad\ning of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vin\u00adcristine11. \nOther patients, including those with metastatic disease \nand high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to \nbenefit from doxorubicin12\u201316. Moreover, as inno\u00advative \ntechniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic \nprocedures are improving.\nLocalized disease. Similar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, \nthe UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend \npreoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients \nnewly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656\u00a0months, \nbased on results of previous SIOP trials that showed \ntumour downstaging using this regimen2,6,8,9,14,17. This \nbenefit was also independently observed in the random\u00ad\nized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK \nChildren\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, \npreviously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study \nGroup)18. In patients receiving preoperative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could \nbe reduced by 20% compared with those treated with \ndirect nephrectomy, with no significant difference in \nsurvival18. The SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of \nmisdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending \ndirect surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy \nfor children <6\u00a0months old, and the consideration of \nfine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clin\u00ad\nical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To \navoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment \nbefore treatment is not advocated. This approach has \nbeen shown to be safe and identifies the vast major\u00ad\nity of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at \nrisk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative \nchemotherapy.\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables \npersonalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, \nincluding identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type \nWilms tumours. The centralized review process of histo\u00ad\nlogy, undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG, has shown that \nidentification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and \nclinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type \nhistology might be improved by considering the abso\u00ad\nlute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative \npercentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol19.\nAuthor addresses\n1Department of Paediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology, \nLundlaan 6, 3584EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n2Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, 30 Guilford \nSt, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.\n3Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066\u2009CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n4Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, Saarland University, Kirrberger Str. \n100, 66421, Homburg, Germany.\n5Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, La Timone Children\u2019s Hospital, 264 \nRue Saint-Pierre, 13385, Marseille, France.\n6Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff University \nSchool of Medicine, Heath Park, Eastern Ave, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom.\n7Kiel Paediatric Tumour Registry, Department of Paediatric Pathology, University Hospital \nof Kiel, Christian-Albrechts-Platz 4, 24118, Kiel, Germany.\n8Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of the Saarland, Kirrberger Str. 100, \n66421, Homburg, Germany.\n9Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, \n1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n10Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, \nHeidelberglaan 100, 3584\u2009CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n11Department of Paediatric Surgery, Marciniak Hospital, Fieldorfa 2, 54\u2013049, \nWroclaw, Poland.\n12Department of Paediatric Traumatology and Emergency Medicine, Medical University, \nWybrzeze Ludwika Pasteura 1, 50\u2013367, Wroclaw, Poland.\n13Department of Paediatric Oncology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo, \nAv.

This data collection, in combination with the \nresults of planned integrated biomarker and imaging \nstudies (which will assess the relative contribution of \ngain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), \nmight be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm \nof the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new \nstandard management regimen for most patients in the \nUMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2212III intermediate-risk \nWilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27\u00a0weeks of \nvincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. \nThis schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease \nin event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on \noverall survival compared with 27\u00a0weeks of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at \n50\u2009mg/m2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u20112001 trial2.\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was car\u00ad\nried out to examine the association between omit\u00ad\nting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with \nlarge-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a vol\u00ad\nume >500\u2009ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal \nand epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prog\u00ad\nnosis20, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only \nstage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type \ntumours (n\u2009=\u2009429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients \nwith large-volume tumours had an estimated 5\u2011year \nEFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume \ntumours (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.01) (FIG.\u00a02). Most importantly, \nEFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, \nlog rank P\u2009=\u20090.0005) when doxorubicin was added to \nthe treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500\u2009ml) \ntumours (FIG.\u00a03). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in \npost\u00adoperative treatment of patients with large-\u00advolume \n(\u2265500\u2009ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial \ntumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue \ntreatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the \nregimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results \nof the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that \nin SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by \nchanging to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule \nfor patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS \nincreased from 67% to 80% (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.006) avoiding \nintensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number \nof patients12.\nMetastatic disease (stage IV). Overall, ~17% of patients \nwith Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at \ndiagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous meta\u00ad\nstases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdom\u00ad\ninal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are \nby far the most frequently observed21\u201323.

Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor \nStudy Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed \nthat patients with CT\u2011only nodules who were treated \nwith vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin \nhad superior EFS to those who received vincristine and \nactinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in \nboth groups25. Including CT\u2011only nodules in the defi\u00ad\nnition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with \nintermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve \na rapid complete response of their CT\u2011only nodules. \nThese patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy \nand have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term \nsequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or \nsecondary malignancies.\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for \nmetastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, \nand doxo\u00adrubicin regimen for 6\u00a0weeks, followed by reas\u00ad\nsessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and \nmetastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. \nWith this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients \nhave complete metastatic response before surgery21,23. \nDetailed guidelines are provided for the stratification \nof postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumu\u00ad\nlative dose of doxo\u00adrubicin has been lowered in order to \nreduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose \nfor patients with metastatic disease was 300\u2009mg/m2 in \nSIOP\u22122001, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 \ntrial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2 for patients with favourable histo\u00ad\nlogy does not considerably affect survival25,26. For this \nreason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends strati\u00ad\nfying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin \nD plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxo\u00adrubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2, vincristine, and actinomycin D \nplus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of \n250\u2009mg/m2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide \n(150\u2009mg/m2/day), carboplatin (200\u2009mg/m2/day), cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide (450\u2009mg/m2/day), and doxorubicin (cumu\u00ad\nlative dose 300\u2009mg/m2). Stratification is based on local \nstage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary \ntumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size \nof metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative \ntreatment and surgery (TABLE\u00a02).\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-\nrisk characteristics on histological examination are a \nrare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prog\u00adnosis. \nOnly a few patients per year will be stratified into this \ncategory. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local \ncentres discuss the best current treatment approach \nwith the principle investigator for stage IV disease. \nCurrently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen \nbased on unpublished but presented data from the COG27, \nincluding combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, \nfollowed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem \ncell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physi\u00ad\ncian. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this \nsubgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable \noutcomes has been reported by several groups in the pri\u00ad\nmary and relapsed settings28\u201330. Details of this suggested \nregimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA \nprotocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes \nwill be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and \ncan, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\nFigure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

Synchronous bilateral Wilms \ntumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of \nWilms tumour and long-term overall survival is cur\u00ad\nrently ~80%31\u201335. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the \nmost clinically significant morbidity for patients with \nbilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by under\u00ad\nlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-\u00ad\nrelated loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et\u00a0al.35 \nobserved that functional renal outcome was consider\u00ad\nably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery \n(NSS) than when other types of surgery were used35. \nIndependently of the type of treatment, children with \nWilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and \nretardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes \nassociated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of \nESRD36. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial sur\u00ad\ngery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol35. However, other important causes of ESRD \nexist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral \nnephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term moni\u00ad\ntoring of renal function is required after treatment of \nbilateral disease. In the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with \nbilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy \nincluding vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS \nwas deemed feasible, with response evaluations per\u00ad\nformed every 4\u00a0weeks. However, several studies have \nshown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is \noften ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours \nare the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and \ncould even result in an increased risk of the presence \nof anaplasia, disease progression, and development of \nmetastases31,32,34. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits \npreoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12\u00a0weeks, \nwith time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6\u00a0weeks, to be \ncomparable with the COG approach for future studies. \nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous \nbilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are \npresent, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances \nof tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability switching \nto treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recom\u00ad\nmended, to avoid use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can \nbe considered to determine histology.\nRelapsed Wilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol \nprovides structured guidelines for the treatment of \npatients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective \nstudies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology \nand the first-line treatment used37\u201339. Thus, patients with \nrelapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into \nthree groups in the UMBRELLA protocol, group AA, \ngroup BB, and group CC, based on these factors.\nTreatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, \ndefined as patients with initial stage I\u2212II low-risk or \nintermediate-risk tumours, who received only vin\u00ad\ncristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in \ntheir first-line treatment, will include four drugs (com\u00ad\nbinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and \ncarboplatin and/or etoposide).

    "so the UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guide\u00ad\nlines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at \nrelapse. These guidelines include considering resection \nafter proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, independently of histological subtype or risk \ngroup, when radical surgery seems possible or when \nit is useful to evaluate histological tumour response. \nApplying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites \nis uniformly accepted, but developing standard recom\u00ad\nmendations for the approach to previously irradiated \nsites is difficult, because of the many different situations \nencountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA \nproto\u00adcol recommends contacting radiotherapists on \nthe SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\nInfant Wilms tumours. Infants, defined as patients \nyounger than 6\u00a0months (182\u00a0days), should be considered \nfor primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol, unless tumours are judged not amenable to immed\u00ad\niate nephrectomy in a multidisciplinary team consensus. \nThe reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared \nwith older children, a higher proportion of renal tumours \nin infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malig\u00ad\nnant rhabdoid tumours that either need surgery alone \n(congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than \nactinomycin D and vincristine)44,45. Percutaneous cutting \nneedle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV \ndisease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. \nPostoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumour is similar \nin infants to that in older children who underwent direct \nnephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according \nto age and body weight based on the experience from \nprevious SIOP studies44.\nAdult Wilms tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol reg\u00ad\nisters and provides comprehensive guidelines for the \nmanagement of adults with Wilms tumours, recog\u00ad\nnizing the long treatment delays and associated poor \noutcomes experienced by adult patients in the past46\u201349. \nThe diagnosis of Wilms tumour in adults is exceptional \nand treatment recommendations are based on literature \nreview and broad international and multi\u00addisciplinary \nconsensus, as published in 2011 (REF.\u00a046). Adult Wilms \ntumour is often diagnosed unexpectedly after neph\u00ad\nrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare \ninstances in which the diagnosis of Wilms tumour \nis histologically proven before surgery, preoperative \nchemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment \nstrategies for Wilms tumour diagnosed in childhood. \nIn contrast to the histological classification of child\u00ad\nhood Wilms tumours, both focal and diffuse ana\u00adplasia \nare considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no \nevidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have \nbetter outcomes50.\nAdult patients often experience considerable delays \nbefore starting postoperative chemotherapy, owing to \nthe time needed to verify histology46\u201349. For this reason, \npostoperative treatment recommendations for chil\u00ad\ndren cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For \ninstance, the treatment regimen for paediatric stage I \ndisease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised \nfor a selected group of adult stage I patients without \nanaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more \nintensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with \nnonanaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for \nanaplastic tumours of any stage. Exceptions can be \nmade in individual instances, in which diagnosis of \na stage II Wilms tumour with favourable histology is \ntimely and postoperative chemotherapy can start within \n14\u00a0days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose inten\u00ad\nsity is decreased in guidelines for treatment of adult \nWilms tumours compared with standard guidelines for \nchildren, as adults more frequently develop severe \nneurological toxicities48.\nSurgical recommendations\nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumour \nnephrectomy is the standard of care for children with \nWilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies \nsurgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of \nlymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to \nsample seven locoregional lymph nodes, for the purpose \nof accurate staging51\u201353.\nNSS is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral \nWilms tumours under certain conditions, specified in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol, that include small tumour \nvolume (<300\u2009ml) and the expectation of a substantial \nremnant kidney function in patients with tumours \n<300\u2009ml who never had lymph node involvement52. \nA new classification system for NSS, developed by a \ngroup of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, \nwas adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to opti\u00ad\nmize comparison of patient outcomes54 (TABLE\u00a03). For \nbi\u00adlateral Wilms tumours, discussion with the SIOP\u2212\nRTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended, in order \nto assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk \nof upstaging by incomplete resection of the tumour. \nTable 3 | Classification of nephron-sparing\nAspect*\nDescription\nSurgical \ntechnique\n\u2022\tNSS (A)\u2009=\u2009Partial Nephrectomy\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour with a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\n\u2022\tNSS (B)\u2009=\u2009Enucleation\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour without a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\nSurgical \nresection \nmargin (SRM)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudo-capsule\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tDoubt\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nPathological \nresection \nmargin (PRM)\n\u2022\tSafe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except \nnephroblastomatosis\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudocapsule along the resection margin\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nRemaining renal \nparenchyma \n(RRP)\n\u2022\tA subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage \nof renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney\u2009=\u2009(n %)\n\u2022\tFor example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP \nof 70%.\nNSS, nephron-sparing surgery *A classification for each case would be reported as follows: \nNSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).

    "Where possible, surgery should be performed in iden\u00ad\ntified reference centres. Issues related to minimally \ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, \nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these \ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, \nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non\u00ad\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node \nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery \nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be \nsafely performed.\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms \ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or \nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio\u00ad\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based \non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and \nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55 (TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost \ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III \nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data \nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was \nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu\u00ad\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung \nirradiation was decreased from 15\u2009Gy to 12\u2009Gy in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS \nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall \nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\u00ad\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, \nactinomycin\u2011D, vincristine, and 12\u2009Gy to the lungs13.\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for \nintermediate-\u00adrisk or high-risk histology tumours \nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery) \npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or \nmacro\u00adscopic peritoneal deposits.\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for \nlung metastases lacking complete response by post\u00ad\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority \nof patients achieving a complete response after induc\u00ad\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need \nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival \neven without radiotherapy (5\u2011year EFS 84%, 5\u2011year OS \n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso\u00adciated with poor \nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio\u00ad\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with \nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence \nin the lung, whole-lung ir\u00adradiation is recommended for \npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during \nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults \nand children with Wilms tumours, with the exception \nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi\u00ad\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II \nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not \nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in \nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes \nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of \nradiotherapy be discussed.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed \ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that \nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if \nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther\u00ad\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours \nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and \nneeds further investigation before implementation in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\nTable 5 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for metastatic disease\nLung\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nLiver\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBrain\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBone\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\n12.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10\u201313\u2009Gy)*\n14.4/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\nHigh-risk\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 15\u201320\u2009Gy)*\n19.8/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\nTable 4 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\nStage I\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage II\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III (major rupture)\u2021\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\nno\nno\n14.41.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7\nHigh-risk blastemal-\ntype Wilms tumour\nno\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\nHigh-risk diffuse \nanaplasia\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple \nresidual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n750 | DECEMBER 2017 | VOLUME 14\t\nwww.nature.com/nrurol\n\u00a9\n 2\n0\n1\n7\n M\na\nc\nm\ni\nl\nl\na\nn\n P\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nr\ns\n L\ni\nm\ni\nt\ne\nd\n,\n p\na\nr\nt\n o\nf\n S\np\nr\ni\nn\ng\ne\nr\n N\na\nt\nu\nr\ne\n.\n A\nl\nl\n r\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n r\ne\ns\ne\nr\nv\ne\nd\n.",

In gen\u00ad\neral, survival is excellent, but the SIOP\u2013RTSG aims \nto address the current geographic inequalities in \nchildhood cancer survival by providing a standard\u00ad\nized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and \ntreatment. Furthermore, estimates suggest that ~300 \ninstances of complex renal tumours in Europe would \nbenefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treat\u00ad\nment with clinicians at centres of expertise5. Examples \ninclude most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, \npatients with extensive intravascular tumour throm\u00ad\nbus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced dif\u00ad\nfuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these \ndiseases could benefit from international collabora\u00ad\ntion to access specialized surgical techniques, cardio\u00ad\nthoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, \nand guidance for phase\u00a0I/II trials. European initia\u00ad\ntives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology \nReference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment \n(ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim \nto enhance such collaboration. The EXPO\u2011R\u2011Net is \nan online consultation platform for which national \nreference centres have been identified (FIG.\u00a04), and \nthis platform should contribute to the establish\u00ad\nment of international tumour boards, funding for \nco\u00adordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future \noutreach to low-income countries.\nConclusions\nAs well as providing a useful guideline for routine \nclinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should \nstimulate international collaboration and research. \nBy standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumour \ntypes, prospectively collected data from a large, homo\u00ad\ngenous cohort of patients will be available for future \nvali\u00addation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, \nand thera\u00adpeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA \nprotocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available \ntreatment standard. It will be the backbone \nfor new treatment approaches in future phase\u00a0\nI/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration \nwith the COG will continue to be sought. Global \ncollaboration is still necessary for finding effec\u00ad\ntive treatments for the most unfavourable Wilms \ntumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, \nand relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA \nprotocol will contribute to this aim.\nFigure 4 | Centres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference \nNetwork for Diagnostics and Treatment.\n1.\t\nSIOP Renal Tumour Study Group.

    "The Renal Tumour Study Group of the International \nSociety of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP\u2013RTSG) has \ndeveloped a new protocol for diagnosis and treatment \nof childhood renal tumours, UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG \n2016 (referred to as the UMBRELLA protocol), to con\u00ad\ntinue international collaboration in the treatment of \nchildhood renal tumours1. The UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol succeeds the SIOP\u22122001 protocol2. The name \nUMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect \ninformation concerning all paediatric primary renal \ntumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data \nregistry, which includes embedded review of diag\u00ad\nnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment \nrecom\u00admendations1 (FIG.\u00a01). The UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol will support integrated biomarker and imaging \nresearch, with a particular focus on assessing the inde\u00ad\npendent prognostic value of genomic changes within \nthe tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent \nof its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of \nthe blastemal component that survives preoperative \nchemotherapy3,4.\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively un\u00adcommon, \naccounting for ~5% of all paediatric malignancies. \nOf these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to \nbe Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours \n(non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma \nof the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhab\u00ad\ndoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic \nnephroma are even less common5. The exact incidence \nof non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the prob\u00ad\nable under-registration of patients with these tumours \nin renal tumour protocols.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms \ntumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available \non the SIOP\u2013RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after \nlaunch in 2017. All countries that are interested in join\u00ad\ning the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access \nto the treatment schedules, based on their commitment \n1Department of \nPaediatric Oncology, \nPrincess M\u00e1xima Center \nfor Paediatric Oncology, \nLundlaan 6, \n3584EA Utrecht, \nThe Netherlands.\nCorrespondence to \nM.M.v.d.H.-E.\nm.m.vandenheuvel-eibrink\n@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl\ndoi:10.1038/nrurol.2017.163\nPublished online 31 Oct 2017\nPOSITION PAPER\nRationale for the treatment of \nWilms tumour in the UMBRELLA \nSIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 protocol\nMarry M. van den Heuvel-Eibrink1, Janna A.

    "to register renal tumour patients. This Consensus \nStatement focuses on the rationale for treatment of \nWilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nTreatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the \nUMBRELLA protocol include recommendations \nfor localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral dis\u00ad\nease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. \nThese recom\u00admendations were established by a multi\u00ad\ndisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours \nwithin the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncolo\u00ad\ngists, radio\u00adlogists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation \noncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic \nresearch. Thorough communications were undertaken \nwith colleagues with similar expertise involved in the \nChildren\u2019s Oncology Group (COG), to ensure all rele\u00ad\nvant evidence was applied when deciding how to imple\u00ad\nment the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial, \nwhich investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in \ntreating stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours, \nand to refine recommendations for patients with \nWilms tumour. Over the past 15\u00a0years, wide-ranging \ndiscussions on global strategies for children with renal \ntumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG \nduring meetings and workshops. These conversations \nhave resulted in sharing of data and knowledge, which \nhas been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA \nguideline for diagnostics and treatment.\nTreatment recommendations\nIn general, treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to \nthe patient based on tumour stage and histology, and \ninvolves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, \nand, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP \nprotocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been \nsuccessfully reduced for the majority of patients with \nWilms tumours, and survival has risen to 90%2,6\u201310. \nConsequently, the identification of additional predic\u00ad\ntive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to \nimprove the stratification of patients according to their \nindividual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients \nwith Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consist\u00ad\ning of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vin\u00adcristine11. \nOther patients, including those with metastatic disease \nand high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to \nbenefit from doxorubicin12\u201316. Moreover, as inno\u00advative \ntechniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic \nprocedures are improving.\nLocalized disease. Similar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, \nthe UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend \npreoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients \nnewly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656\u00a0months, \nbased on results of previous SIOP trials that showed \ntumour downstaging using this regimen2,6,8,9,14,17. This \nbenefit was also independently observed in the random\u00ad\nized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK \nChildren\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, \npreviously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study \nGroup)18. In patients receiving preoperative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could \nbe reduced by 20% compared with those treated with \ndirect nephrectomy, with no significant difference in \nsurvival18. The SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of \nmisdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending \ndirect surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy \nfor children <6\u00a0months old, and the consideration of \nfine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clin\u00ad\nical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To \navoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment \nbefore treatment is not advocated. This approach has \nbeen shown to be safe and identifies the vast major\u00ad\nity of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at \nrisk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative \nchemotherapy.\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables \npersonalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, \nincluding identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type \nWilms tumours. The centralized review process of histo\u00ad\nlogy, undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG, has shown that \nidentification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and \nclinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type \nhistology might be improved by considering the abso\u00ad\nlute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative \npercentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol19.\nAuthor addresses\n1Department of Paediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Paediatric Oncology, \nLundlaan 6, 3584EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n2Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, 30 Guilford \nSt, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.\n3Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066\u2009CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n4Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, Saarland University, Kirrberger Str. \n100, 66421, Homburg, Germany.\n5Department of Paediatric Oncology & Haematology, La Timone Children\u2019s Hospital, 264 \nRue Saint-Pierre, 13385, Marseille, France.\n6Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff University \nSchool of Medicine, Heath Park, Eastern Ave, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom.\n7Kiel Paediatric Tumour Registry, Department of Paediatric Pathology, University Hospital \nof Kiel, Christian-Albrechts-Platz 4, 24118, Kiel, Germany.\n8Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of the Saarland, Kirrberger Str. 100, \n66421, Homburg, Germany.\n9Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, \n1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n10Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, \nHeidelberglaan 100, 3584\u2009CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\n11Department of Paediatric Surgery, Marciniak Hospital, Fieldorfa 2, 54\u2013049, \nWroclaw, Poland.\n12Department of Paediatric Traumatology and Emergency Medicine, Medical University, \nWybrzeze Ludwika Pasteura 1, 50\u2013367, Wroclaw, Poland.\n13Department of Paediatric Oncology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo, \nAv.

Prospective \ndata from patients who are stratified and treated based \non standardized recommendations will be collected and \nanalysed. This data collection, in combination with the \nresults of planned integrated biomarker and imaging \nstudies (which will assess the relative contribution of \ngain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), \nmight be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm \nof the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new \nstandard management regimen for most patients in the \nUMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2212III intermediate-risk \nWilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27\u00a0weeks of \nvincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. \nThis schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease \nin event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on \noverall survival compared with 27\u00a0weeks of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at \n50\u2009mg/m2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u20112001 trial2.\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was car\u00ad\nried out to examine the association between omit\u00ad\nting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with \nlarge-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a vol\u00ad\nume >500\u2009ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal \nand epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prog\u00ad\nnosis20, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only \nstage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type \ntumours (n\u2009=\u2009429). In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients \nwith large-volume tumours had an estimated 5\u2011year \nEFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume \ntumours (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.01) (FIG.\u00a02). Most importantly, \nEFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, \nlog rank P\u2009=\u20090.0005) when doxorubicin was added to \nthe treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500\u2009ml) \ntumours (FIG.\u00a03). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in \npost\u00adoperative treatment of patients with large-\u00advolume \n(\u2265500\u2009ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial \ntumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue \ntreatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the \nregimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results \nof the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that \nin SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by \nchanging to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule \nfor patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS \nincreased from 67% to 80% (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.006) avoiding \nintensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number \nof patients12.\nMetastatic disease (stage IV). Overall, ~17% of patients \nwith Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at \ndiagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous meta\u00ad\nstases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdom\u00ad\ninal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are \nby far the most frequently observed21\u201323. The increas\u00ad\ning use of chest CT as routine imaging for staging has \nresulted in the detection of small pulmonary nodules \nFigure 1 | The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo.

Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor \nStudy Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed \nthat patients with CT\u2011only nodules who were treated \nwith vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin \nhad superior EFS to those who received vincristine and \nactinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in \nboth groups25. Including CT\u2011only nodules in the defi\u00ad\nnition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with \nintermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve \na rapid complete response of their CT\u2011only nodules. \nThese patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy \nand have, therefore, a reduced risk of severe long-term \nsequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications or \nsecondary malignancies.\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for \nmetastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, \nand doxo\u00adrubicin regimen for 6\u00a0weeks, followed by reas\u00ad\nsessment imaging of local tumour (using MRI) and \nmetastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. \nWith this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients \nhave complete metastatic response before surgery21,23. \nDetailed guidelines are provided for the stratification \nof postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumu\u00ad\nlative dose of doxo\u00adrubicin has been lowered in order to \nreduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose \nfor patients with metastatic disease was 300\u2009mg/m2 in \nSIOP\u22122001, preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 \ntrial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2 for patients with favourable histo\u00ad\nlogy does not considerably affect survival25,26. For this \nreason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends strati\u00ad\nfying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin \nD plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxo\u00adrubicin \ndose of 150\u2009mg/m2, vincristine, and actinomycin D \nplus doxorubicin with cumulative doxorubicin of \n250\u2009mg/m2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide \n(150\u2009mg/m2/day), carboplatin (200\u2009mg/m2/day), cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide (450\u2009mg/m2/day), and doxorubicin (cumu\u00ad\nlative dose 300\u2009mg/m2). Stratification is based on local \nstage of the primary tumour, histology of the primary \ntumour and the metastatic tumour (if resected), the size \nof metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative \ntreatment and surgery (TABLE\u00a02).\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-\nrisk characteristics on histological examination are a \nrare subgroup, with recognized unfavourable prog\u00adnosis. \nOnly a few patients per year will be stratified into this \ncategory. Thus, UMBRELLA protocol advises that local \ncentres discuss the best current treatment approach \nwith the principle investigator for stage IV disease. \nCurrently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen \nbased on unpublished but presented data from the COG27, \nincluding combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclo\u00ad\nphosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, \nfollowed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem \ncell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physi\u00ad\ncian. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this \nsubgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favourable \noutcomes has been reported by several groups in the pri\u00ad\nmary and relapsed settings28\u201330. Details of this suggested \nregimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA \nprotocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes \nwill be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and \ncan, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\nFigure 2 | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial \nWilms tumour in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

Synchronous bilateral Wilms \ntumour (stage V) accounts for ~5\u20138% of instances of \nWilms tumour and long-term overall survival is cur\u00ad\nrently ~80%31\u201335. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the \nmost clinically significant morbidity for patients with \nbilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by under\u00ad\nlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-\u00ad\nrelated loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et\u00a0al.35 \nobserved that functional renal outcome was consider\u00ad\nably better after bilateral nephron sparing surgery \n(NSS) than when other types of surgery were used35. \nIndependently of the type of treatment, children with \nWilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and \nretardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash or other syndromes \nassociated with WT1 mutations, are at increased risk of \nESRD36. Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial sur\u00ad\ngery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol35. However, other important causes of ESRD \nexist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral \nnephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term moni\u00ad\ntoring of renal function is required after treatment of \nbilateral disease. In the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with \nbilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy \nincluding vincristine and actinomycin D until NSS \nwas deemed feasible, with response evaluations per\u00ad\nformed every 4\u00a0weeks. However, several studies have \nshown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is \noften ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours \nare the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and \ncould even result in an increased risk of the presence \nof anaplasia, disease progression, and development of \nmetastases31,32,34. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits \npreoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12\u00a0weeks, \nwith time intervals for evaluation fixed to 6\u00a0weeks, to be \ncomparable with the COG approach for future studies. \nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous \nbilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are \npresent, is, from experience, extremely rare.

    "so the UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guide\u00ad\nlines for administering radiotherapy and surgery at \nrelapse. These guidelines include considering resection \nafter proven reduction of relapsed disease after chemo\u00ad\ntherapy, independently of histological subtype or risk \ngroup, when radical surgery seems possible or when \nit is useful to evaluate histological tumour response. \nApplying radiotherapy to initially nonirradiated sites \nis uniformly accepted, but developing standard recom\u00ad\nmendations for the approach to previously irradiated \nsites is difficult, because of the many different situations \nencountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA \nproto\u00adcol recommends contacting radiotherapists on \nthe SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\nInfant Wilms tumours. Infants, defined as patients \nyounger than 6\u00a0months (182\u00a0days), should be considered \nfor primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA proto\u00ad\ncol, unless tumours are judged not amenable to immed\u00ad\niate nephrectomy in a multidisciplinary team consensus. \nThe reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared \nwith older children, a higher proportion of renal tumours \nin infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malig\u00ad\nnant rhabdoid tumours that either need surgery alone \n(congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemo\u00ad\ntherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than \nactinomycin D and vincristine)44,45. Percutaneous cutting \nneedle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV \ndisease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. \nPostoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumour is similar \nin infants to that in older children who underwent direct \nnephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according \nto age and body weight based on the experience from \nprevious SIOP studies44.\nAdult Wilms tumours. The UMBRELLA protocol reg\u00ad\nisters and provides comprehensive guidelines for the \nmanagement of adults with Wilms tumours, recog\u00ad\nnizing the long treatment delays and associated poor \noutcomes experienced by adult patients in the past46\u201349. \nThe diagnosis of Wilms tumour in adults is exceptional \nand treatment recommendations are based on literature \nreview and broad international and multi\u00addisciplinary \nconsensus, as published in 2011 (REF.\u00a046). Adult Wilms \ntumour is often diagnosed unexpectedly after neph\u00ad\nrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare \ninstances in which the diagnosis of Wilms tumour \nis histologically proven before surgery, preoperative \nchemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment \nstrategies for Wilms tumour diagnosed in childhood. \nIn contrast to the histological classification of child\u00ad\nhood Wilms tumours, both focal and diffuse ana\u00adplasia \nare considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no \nevidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have \nbetter outcomes50.\nAdult patients often experience considerable delays \nbefore starting postoperative chemotherapy, owing to \nthe time needed to verify histology46\u201349. For this reason, \npostoperative treatment recommendations for chil\u00ad\ndren cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For \ninstance, the treatment regimen for paediatric stage I \ndisease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised \nfor a selected group of adult stage I patients without \nanaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more \nintensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine \nand actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with \nnonanaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for \nanaplastic tumours of any stage. Exceptions can be \nmade in individual instances, in which diagnosis of \na stage II Wilms tumour with favourable histology is \ntimely and postoperative chemotherapy can start within \n14\u00a0days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose inten\u00ad\nsity is decreased in guidelines for treatment of adult \nWilms tumours compared with standard guidelines for \nchildren, as adults more frequently develop severe \nneurological toxicities48.\nSurgical recommendations\nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumour \nnephrectomy is the standard of care for children with \nWilms tumour. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies \nsurgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of \nlymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to \nsample seven locoregional lymph nodes, for the purpose \nof accurate staging51\u201353.\nNSS is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral \nWilms tumours under certain conditions, specified in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol, that include small tumour \nvolume (<300\u2009ml) and the expectation of a substantial \nremnant kidney function in patients with tumours \n<300\u2009ml who never had lymph node involvement52. \nA new classification system for NSS, developed by a \ngroup of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, \nwas adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to opti\u00ad\nmize comparison of patient outcomes54 (TABLE\u00a03). For \nbi\u00adlateral Wilms tumours, discussion with the SIOP\u2212\nRTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended, in order \nto assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk \nof upstaging by incomplete resection of the tumour. \nTable 3 | Classification of nephron-sparing\nAspect*\nDescription\nSurgical \ntechnique\n\u2022\tNSS (A)\u2009=\u2009Partial Nephrectomy\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour with a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\n\u2022\tNSS (B)\u2009=\u2009Enucleation\u2009=\u2009resection of tumour without a rim of \nnormal renal parenchyma\nSurgical \nresection \nmargin (SRM)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudo-capsule\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tDoubt\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nPathological \nresection \nmargin (PRM)\n\u2022\tSafe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except \nnephroblastomatosis\u2009=\u2009(0)\n\u2022\tIntact pseudocapsule along the resection margin\u2009=\u2009(1)\n\u2022\tTumour breach\u2009=\u2009(2)\nRemaining renal \nparenchyma \n(RRP)\n\u2022\tA subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage \nof renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney\u2009=\u2009(n %)\n\u2022\tFor example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP \nof 70%.\nNSS, nephron-sparing surgery *A classification for each case would be reported as follows: \nNSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).

    "Where possible, surgery should be performed in iden\u00ad\ntified reference centres. Issues related to minimally \ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated, \nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these \ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, \nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non\u00ad\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node \nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery \nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be \nsafely performed.\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms \ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or \nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio\u00ad\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based \non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and \nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55 (TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost \ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III \nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA \nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data \nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was \nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu\u00ad\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung \nirradiation was decreased from 15\u2009Gy to 12\u2009Gy in the \nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS \nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall \nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\u00ad\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, \nactinomycin\u2011D, vincristine, and 12\u2009Gy to the lungs13.\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for \nintermediate-\u00adrisk or high-risk histology tumours \nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery) \npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or \nmacro\u00adscopic peritoneal deposits.\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for \nlung metastases lacking complete response by post\u00ad\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority \nof patients achieving a complete response after induc\u00ad\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need \nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival \neven without radiotherapy (5\u2011year EFS 84%, 5\u2011year OS \n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso\u00adciated with poor \nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio\u00ad\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with \nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence \nin the lung, whole-lung ir\u00adradiation is recommended for \npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during \nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults \nand children with Wilms tumours, with the exception \nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi\u00ad\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II \nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not \nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in \nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes \nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of \nradiotherapy be discussed.\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed \ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that \nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if \nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther\u00ad\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours \nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and \nneeds further investigation before implementation in \nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\nTable 5 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for metastatic disease\nLung\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nLiver\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBrain\n(whole\u2009\u00b1\u2009boost)\n(total/fraction dose)\nBone\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\n12.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10\u201313\u2009Gy)*\n14.4/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\nHigh-risk\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 15\u201320\u2009Gy)*\n19.8/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n30.6/1.8 Gy\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\nTable 4 | Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\nStage I\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage II\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III\n(total/fraction dose)\nStage III (major rupture)\u2021\n(total/fraction dose)\nLow-risk\nno\nno\nno\nno\nIntermediate-risk\nno\nno\n14.41.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n15.0/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7\nHigh-risk blastemal-\ntype Wilms tumour\nno\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\nHigh-risk diffuse \nanaplasia\nno\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n25.2/1.8 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n19.5/1.5 Gy\n(\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only. \u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen. \u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple \nresidual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy)\nCONSENSUS STATEMENT\n750 | DECEMBER 2017 | VOLUME 14\t\nwww.nature.com/nrurol\n\u00a9\n 2\n0\n1\n7\n M\na\nc\nm\ni\nl\nl\na\nn\n P\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nr\ns\n L\ni\nm\ni\nt\ne\nd\n,\n p\na\nr\nt\n o\nf\n S\np\nr\ni\nn\ng\ne\nr\n N\na\nt\nu\nr\ne\n.\n A\nl\nl\n r\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n r\ne\ns\ne\nr\nv\ne\nd\n.": {

In gen\u00ad\neral, survival is excellent, but the SIOP\u2013RTSG aims \nto address the current geographic inequalities in \nchildhood cancer survival by providing a standard\u00ad\nized approach to diagnosis, risk stratification, and \ntreatment. Furthermore, estimates suggest that ~300 \ninstances of complex renal tumours in Europe would \nbenefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treat\u00ad\nment with clinicians at centres of expertise5. Examples \ninclude most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, \npatients with extensive intravascular tumour throm\u00ad\nbus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced dif\u00ad\nfuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these \ndiseases could benefit from international collabora\u00ad\ntion to access specialized surgical techniques, cardio\u00ad\nthoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, \nand guidance for phase\u00a0I/II trials. European initia\u00ad\ntives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology \nReference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment \n(ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim \nto enhance such collaboration.

Moreover, the UMBRELLA \nprotocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available \ntreatment standard. It will be the backbone \nfor new treatment approaches in future phase\u00a0\nI/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration \nwith the COG will continue to be sought. Global \ncollaboration is still necessary for finding effec\u00ad\ntive treatments for the most unfavourable Wilms \ntumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, \nand relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA \nprotocol will contribute to this aim.\nFigure 4 | Centres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference \nNetwork for Diagnostics and Treatment.\n1.\t\nSIOP Renal Tumour Study Group.
