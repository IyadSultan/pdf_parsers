The UMBRELLA protocol succeeds the SIOP\u20132001 protocol. The name UMBRELLA signifies the ambitious aim to collect information concerning all paediatric primary renal tumours in a comprehensive multidimensional data registry, which includes embedded review of diagnostics, standardized biobanking, and treatment recommendations (FIG. 1). The UMBRELLA protocol will support integrated biomarker and imaging research, with a particular focus on assessing the independent prognostic value of genomic changes within the tumour (chromosomal gain of 1q and the extent of its intratumoral heterogeneity) and the volume of the blastemal component that survives preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nChildhood renal tumours are relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately 5% of all paediatric malignancies. Of these tumours, around 80\u201390% are thought to be Wilms tumours, whereas other renal tumours (non-Wilms tumours), including clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma, are even less common. The exact incidence of non-Wilms tumours is unclear, owing to the probable under-registration of patients with these tumours in renal tumour protocols.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol addresses both Wilms tumours and non-Wilms tumours, and will be available on the SIOP\u2013RTSG website (www.siop-rtsg.eu) after its launch in 2017. All countries that are interested in joining the UMBRELLA protocol will be given full access to the treatment schedules, based on their commitment.\n\n1.

Treatment guidelines for Wilms tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol include recommendations for localized, metastatic (stage IV), and bilateral disease, for all age groups, and for relapsed disease. These recommendations were established by a multidisciplinary panel of leading experts on renal tumours within the SIOP\u2013RTSG, including paediatric oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, statisticians, and scientists involved in basic research. Thorough communications were undertaken with colleagues with similar expertise involved in the Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG) to ensure all relevant evidence was applied when deciding how to implement the results of the SIOP\u22122001 randomized trial, which investigated the safety of omitting doxorubicin in treating stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours, and to refine recommendations for patients with Wilms tumour. Over the past 15 years, wide-ranging discussions on global strategies for children with renal tumours have evolved between SIOP\u2013RTSG and COG during meetings and workshops. These conversations have resulted in the sharing of data and knowledge, which has been used in the design of the current UMBRELLA guideline for diagnostics and treatment.\n\n### Treatment Recommendations\n\nIn general, treatment of Wilms tumours is tailored to the patient based on tumour stage and histology, and involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and, sometimes, radiotherapy. Since the first SIOP protocol started in 1971, treatment intensity has been successfully reduced for the majority of patients with Wilms tumours, and survival has risen to 90% (2,6\u201310). Consequently, the identification of additional predictive and prognostic factors is increasingly important to improve the stratification of patients according to their individual risk. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Wilms tumour now receive chemotherapy consisting of only two drugs, actinomycin D and vincristine (11). Other patients, including those with metastatic disease and high-risk histological subtypes, are believed to benefit from doxorubicin (12\u201316). Moreover, as innovative techniques emerge, surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are improving.\n\n**Localized Disease:** Similar to the SIOP\u22122001 protocol, the UMBRELLA protocol continues to recommend preoperative actinomycin D and vincristine for patients newly diagnosed with Wilms tumour aged \u22656 months, based on results of previous SIOP trials that showed tumour downstaging using this regimen (2,6,8,9,14,17). This benefit was also independently observed in the randomized, controlled UKW3 trial conducted by the UK Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (UKCCLG, previously known as the UK Children\u2019s Cancer Study Group) (18). In patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, the use of radiotherapy or doxorubicin could be reduced by 20% compared with those treated with direct nephrectomy, with no significant difference in survival (18). The SIOP\u2013RTSG accounts for the risk of misdiagnosis of Wilms tumour by recommending direct surgery instead of preoperative chemotherapy for children <6 months old, and the consideration of fine-needle biopsy for patients who have unusual clinical presentations or unusual findings on imaging. To avoid treatment delay, routine histological assessment before treatment is not advocated. This approach has been shown to be safe and identifies the vast majority of patients with non-Wilms tumours who are at risk of being unnecessarily treated with preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nFurthermore, preoperative chemotherapy enables personalized assessment of tumour chemosensitivity, including identification of the high-risk, blastemal-type Wilms tumours. The centralized review process of histology, undertaken in the SIOP\u2013RTSG, has shown that identification of the blastemal subtype is feasible and clinically relevant. Yet, the definition of blastemal-type histology might be improved by considering the absolute residual volume of blastema rather than the relative percentage, as will be investigated in the UMBRELLA protocol (19).\n\n### Author Addresses\n\n1.

Prospective data from patients who are stratified and treated based on standardized recommendations will be collected and analyzed. This data collection, in combination with the results of planned integrated biomarker and imaging studies (which will assess the relative contribution of gain of 1q and assessment of residual blastemal volume), might be used to guide stratification in future protocols.\n\nThe therapeutic regimen of the experimental arm of the SIOP\u22122001 trial has been adopted as the new standard management regimen for most patients in the UMBRELLA protocol with stage II\u2013III intermediate-risk Wilms tumours. This regimen consists of 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D without doxorubicin. This schedule resulted in a nonsignificant small decrease in event-free survival (EFS) and had no effect on overall survival compared with 27 weeks of vincristine and actinomycin D plus five doses of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m\u00b2 (the standard arm) in the SIOP\u22122001 trial.\n\nPost hoc analysis of data from SIOP\u22122001 was carried out to examine the association between omitting doxorubicin and the outcomes of patients with large-volume tumours (defined as tumours with a volume >500 ml after preoperative chemotherapy). Stromal and epithelial tumour types, which have excellent prognosis, were excluded from this analysis, leaving only stage II\u2013III regressive, mixed, and focal anaplasia-type tumours (n = 429). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with large-volume tumours had an estimated 5-year EFS of 80% versus 90% for patients with small-volume tumours (log rank P = 0.01) (FIG. 2). Most importantly, EFS was significantly improved (93% versus 67%, log rank P = 0.0005) when doxorubicin was added to the treatment regimen for large-volume (\u2265500 ml) tumours (FIG. 3). Thus, the inclusion of doxorubicin in postoperative treatment of patients with large-volume (\u2265500 ml) stage II\u2013III nonstromal, nonepithelial tumours is recommended in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n\nFurthermore, the UMBRELLA protocol will continue treatment for blastemal-type tumours according to the regimen used in SIOP\u22122001. A comparison of the results of the SIOP\u22122001 and SIOP\u221293\u201301 trials showed that in SIOP\u22122001, in which treatment was intensified by changing to the high-risk tumour treatment schedule for patients with blastemal-type Wilms tumour, EFS increased from 67% to 80% (log rank P = 0.006), avoiding intensive treatment for relapse in a considerable number of patients.\n\n**Metastatic Disease (Stage IV)**  \nOverall, approximately 17% of patients with Wilms tumours present with stage IV disease at diagnosis, which is defined as haematogenous metastases to the lungs, liver, or other sites, or extra-abdominal lymph node metastases. Pulmonary metastases are by far the most frequently observed. The increasing use of chest CT as routine imaging for staging has resulted in the detection of small pulmonary nodules.\n\n**Figure 1** | The UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol logo.

Similar to the COG protocol, CT-only nodules are included in the definition of lung nodules and treated as metastases in the UMBRELLA protocol if they have a transverse diameter of at least 3 mm (REFS 22, 24, 25). The presence of these CT-only nodules was associated with increased relapse risk and reduced survival in a SIOP\u2013RTSG analysis comparing the outcomes of patients with CT-only lung lesions to those with true localized disease. Results from the COG National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5 trials showed that patients with CT-only nodules who were treated with vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin had superior EFS compared to those who received vincristine and actinomycin D only, but overall survival was similar in both groups. Including CT-only nodules in the definition of metastatic disease will benefit patients with intermediate-risk or low-risk histology who achieve a rapid complete response of their CT-only nodules. These patients do not need pulmonary radiotherapy and, therefore, have a reduced risk of severe long-term sequelae such as lung disease, cardiac complications, or secondary malignancies.\n\nSimilar to SIOP\u22122001, preoperative treatment for metastatic (stage IV) disease in the UMBRELLA protocol includes a combined vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin regimen for 6 weeks, followed by reassessment imaging of the local tumor (using MRI) and metastatic sites (using CT and/or MRI) before surgery. With this preoperative regimen, 61\u201367% of patients have a complete metastatic response before surgery. Detailed guidelines are provided for the stratification of postoperative chemotherapy, in which the cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been lowered to reduce cardiac toxicity. The cumulative doxorubicin dose for patients with metastatic disease was 300 mg/m\u00b2 in SIOP\u22122001; preliminary data from the COG AREN0533 trial suggest that using a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2 for patients with favorable histology does not considerably affect survival. For this reason, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends stratifying patients to either vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 150 mg/m\u00b2, vincristine, and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin with a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 250 mg/m\u00b2, or a four-drug regimen including etoposide (150 mg/m\u00b2/day), carboplatin (200 mg/m\u00b2/day), cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m\u00b2/day), and doxorubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m\u00b2). Stratification is based on the local stage of the primary tumor, histology of the primary tumor and the metastatic tumor (if resected), the size of metastatic lesions, and their response to preoperative treatment and surgery (TABLE 2).\n\nNotably, patients with metastatic disease and high-risk characteristics on histological examination are a rare subgroup, with recognized unfavorable prognosis. Only a few patients per year will be stratified into this category. Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol advises that local centers discuss the best current treatment approach with the principal investigator for stage IV disease. Currently, the SIOP\u2013RTSG board suggests a regimen based on unpublished but presented data from the COG, including combinations of vincristine, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation at the discretion of the treating physician. The role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy for this subgroup is under debate, but a trend towards favorable outcomes has been reported by several groups in the primary and relapsed settings. Details of this suggested regimen were added as an appendix to the UMBRELLA protocol. Data on the use of this regimen and outcomes will be prospectively captured in the SIOP database and can, therefore, be evaluated in a descriptive study.\n\n**Figure 2** | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III intermediate-risk, nonstromal, nonepithelial Wilms tumor in the SIOP\u22122001 randomized controlled trial.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most clinically significant morbidity for patients with bilateral Wilms tumours and can be caused by underlying germline genetic aberrations as well as treatment-related loss of functional renal tissue. Aronson et al. (reference 35) observed that functional renal outcomes were considerably better after bilateral nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) than when other types of surgery were used. \n\nIndependently of the type of treatment, children with Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation (WAGR), Denys-Drash, or other syndromes associated with WT1 mutations are at increased risk of ESRD (reference 36). Thus, avoiding total nephrectomy at initial surgery is advised for bilateral tumours in the UMBRELLA protocol (reference 35). However, other important causes of ESRD exist, including tumour recurrence requiring bilateral nephrectomy or renal irradiation. Long-term monitoring of renal function is required after treatment of bilateral disease.\n\nIn the SIOP\u22122001 study, patients with bilateral disease received preoperative chemotherapy, including vincristine and actinomycin D, until NSS was deemed feasible, with response evaluations performed every 4 weeks. However, several studies have shown that prolonged preoperative chemotherapy is often ineffective (especially as many bilateral tumours are the chemotherapy-insensitive stromal subtype) and could even result in an increased risk of the presence of anaplasia, disease progression, and development of metastases (references 31, 32, 34). Thus, the UMBRELLA protocol limits preoperative chemotherapy to a maximum of 12 weeks, with time intervals for evaluation fixed at 6 weeks, to be comparable with the COG approach for future studies.\n\nThe occurrence of misdiagnosis, in which synchronous bilateral renal tumours other than Wilms tumours are present, is, from experience, extremely rare. In instances of tumour nonresponsiveness or inoperability, switching to treatment with etoposide and carboplatin is recommended to avoid the use of anthracyclines, and biopsy can be considered to determine histology.\n\n**Relapsed Wilms Tumour**  \nThe UMBRELLA protocol provides structured guidelines for the treatment of patients with relapsed Wilms tumours. In retrospective studies, the best prognostic factors were initial histology and the first-line treatment used (references 37\u201339). Thus, patients with relapsed tumours will be prospectively classified into three groups in the UMBRELLA protocol: group AA, group BB, and group CC, based on these factors.\n\nTreatment of group AA relapsed Wilms tumours, defined as patients with initial stage I\u2212II low-risk or intermediate-risk tumours who received only vincristine and/or actinomycin D (no radiotherapy) in their first-line treatment, will include four drugs (combinations of doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and/or etoposide). The combination of these drugs has already been tested in two comprehensive studies, the UKW\u2011R protocol and the NWTS\u20115 relapse protocol, but drug combinations and doses varied (references 40, 41).\n\nPatients without initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type histology, who have already received doxorubicin in their initial treatment, will be classified as group BB and receive an intensive reinduction drug regimen (including the combination of etoposide and carboplatin with either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), followed by either high-dose melphalan.\n\n**Figure 3** | Post hoc analysis of data from patients with stage II or III",

Acceptable response rates have been observed with both cyclophosphamide and etoposide, as well as carboplatin and etoposide combinations; however, ifosfamide showed an increased response rate in early-phase trials. In an effort to reduce the risk of ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity, cyclophosphamide will be alternated with ifosfamide in the group BB protocol recommendations. The heterogeneous settings in which the role of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR has been explored, along with the inconclusive results reported, led us to propose a flexible approach to the consolidation phase. High-dose chemotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician, aiming to describe the results in a prospective observational fashion.\n\nRelapsed group CC includes patients with initial diffuse anaplasia or blastemal-type tumors. For patients in this category, as well as for other relapsing patients showing no response to salvage treatment, the UMBRELLA protocol advises trying camptothecins (irinotecan or topotecan) or novel compounds, as these patients will have already received most conventional active agents in their first-line therapy and are likely to develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. In the UMBRELLA protocol, the SIOP\u2013RTSG commits to endorse initiatives dedicated to new drug development in children, such as those launched by the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium.\n\nImportantly, approaches to local treatment (including radiotherapy and surgical excision of relapsing tumor masses) have not been systematically explored.\n\n**Table 2 | Treatment Overview for Stage IV WT Based on Response to Treatment and Histology**\n\n| Metastasis Surgery | Wilms Tumor Histology | Treatment |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Complete remission or very good partial remission | Surgical complete resection if needed | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules 3\u20135 mm: AVD150, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy |\n| | | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease & lung nodules >5 mm or other site: AVD250, no pulmonary radiotherapy unless complete resection of viable metastasis, then pulmonary radiotherapy |\n| | | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease, no evidence of metastasis: Treatment as localized |\n| Partial response or stable disease | Representative nodule resection feasible | Low-risk disease, viable metastasis confirmed: AVD250, lung or metastasis radiotherapy, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules, then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible |\n| | | Low-risk disease, completely necrotic metastasis: AVD150, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules, then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible |\n| | | Low-risk or intermediate-risk disease, no evidence of viable tumor: Contact principal investigator, potentially treatment as localized or AVD250, CT at week 10: if remaining nodules, then surgery recommended to achieve complete response if feasible, no radiotherapy to metastases |\n| | | Intermediate-risk disease, viable metastasis confirmed: Four-drug regimen, radiotherapy to metastasis.

These guidelines include considering resection after proven reduction of relapsed disease following chemotherapy, independently of histological subtype or risk group, when radical surgery seems possible or when it is useful to evaluate histological tumor response. Applying radiotherapy to initially non-irradiated sites is uniformly accepted; however, developing standard recommendations for the approach to previously irradiated sites is challenging due to the many different situations encountered. For these instances, the UMBRELLA protocol recommends contacting radiotherapists on the SIOP\u2212RTSG panel.\n\n**Infant Wilms Tumors**  \nInfants, defined as patients younger than 6 months (182 days), should be considered for primary surgery according to the UMBRELLA protocol, unless tumors are judged not amenable to immediate nephrectomy by a multidisciplinary team consensus. The reason for upfront nephrectomy is that, compared with older children, a higher proportion of renal tumors in infants are congenital mesoblastic nephroma or malignant rhabdoid tumors that either need surgery alone (congenital mesoblastic nephroma) or alternative chemotherapy at the outset (more intensive chemotherapy than actinomycin D and vincristine). Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy is recommended in instances of stage IV disease or when immediate surgery is deemed difficult. Postoperative chemotherapy for Wilms tumor is similar in infants to that in older children who underwent direct nephrectomy, with adjustment of drug doses according to age and body weight based on the experience from previous SIOP studies.\n\n**Adult Wilms Tumors**  \nThe UMBRELLA protocol registers and provides comprehensive guidelines for the management of adults with Wilms tumors, recognizing the long treatment delays and associated poor outcomes experienced by adult patients in the past. The diagnosis of Wilms tumor in adults is exceptional, and treatment recommendations are based on literature review and broad international and multidisciplinary consensus, as published in 2011. Adult Wilms tumor is often diagnosed unexpectedly after nephrectomy for a suspected renal cell carcinoma. In rare instances where the diagnosis of Wilms tumor is histologically proven before surgery, preoperative chemotherapy is recommended, similar to treatment strategies for Wilms tumor diagnosed in childhood. In contrast to the histological classification of childhood Wilms tumors, both focal and diffuse anaplasia are considered high-risk subtypes in adults, as no evidence exists that patients with focal anaplasia have better outcomes.\n\nAdult patients often experience considerable delays before starting postoperative chemotherapy due to the time needed to verify histology. For this reason, postoperative treatment recommendations for children cannot simply be applied to adult patients. For instance, the treatment regimen for pediatric stage I disease of actinomycin D and vincristine is only advised for a selected group of adult stage I patients without anaplasia. All other adult patients will receive more intensive treatment, either consisting of vincristine and actinomycin D plus doxorubicin for patients with non-anaplastic subtypes, or four drugs (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin) for anaplastic tumors of any stage. Exceptions can be made in individual instances where the diagnosis of a stage II Wilms tumor with favorable histology is timely, and postoperative chemotherapy can start within 14 days after surgery. Notably, vincristine dose intensity is decreased in guidelines for the treatment of adult Wilms tumors compared with standard guidelines for children, as adults more frequently develop severe neurological toxicities.\n\n**Surgical Recommendations**  \nAfter preoperative chemotherapy, radical tumor nephrectomy is the standard of care for children with Wilms tumor. The UMBRELLA protocol specifies surgical guidelines and emphasizes the importance of lymph node sampling, stating that the aim should be to sample seven locoregional lymph nodes for the purpose of accurate staging.\n\nNephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is now acceptable for nonsyndromic unilateral Wilms tumors under certain conditions specified in the UMBRELLA protocol, which include small tumor volume (<300 ml) and the expectation of substantial remnant kidney function in patients with tumors <300 ml who have never had lymph node involvement. A new classification system for NSS, developed by a group of surgeons and pathologists from SIOP\u2013RTSG, was adopted in the UMBRELLA protocol to optimize the comparison of patient outcomes (TABLE 3). For bilateral Wilms tumors, discussion with the SIOP\u2212RTSG surgical panel is strongly recommended to assess the feasibility of NSS and minimize the risk of upstaging due to incomplete resection of the tumor.\n\n**Table 3 | Classification of Nephron-Sparing Surgery**  \n| Aspect* | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Surgical technique** | \u2022 NSS (A) = Partial Nephrectomy = resection of tumor with a rim of normal renal parenchyma <br> \u2022 NSS (B) = Enucleation = resection of tumor without a rim of normal renal parenchyma |\n| **Surgical resection margin (SRM)** | \u2022 Intact pseudo-capsule = (0) <br> \u2022 Doubt = (1) <br> \u2022 Tumor breach = (2) |\n| **Pathological resection margin (PRM)** | \u2022 Safe rim of renal parenchyma on resection margin, except nephroblastomatosis = (0) <br> \u2022 Intact pseudocapsule along the resection margin = (1) <br> \u2022 Tumor breach = (2) |\n| **Remaining renal parenchyma (RRP)** | \u2022 A subjective evaluation is done by the surgeon of the percentage of renal parenchyma remaining on the operated kidney = (n %) <br> \u2022 For example, a polar nephrectomy usually corresponds to a RRP of 70%. |\n\n*NSS, nephron-sparing surgery*  \n*A classification for each case would be reported as follows: NSS(X)-SRM(n)-PRM(n)-RRP(n%).*  \nAdapted from Godzinski, J. et al.

Issues related to minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the UMBRELLA protocol. Although not advocated due to a lack of evidence supporting its safety, these techniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances, including small, central tumours with a rim of non-malignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node sampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery should not be performed in patients in whom nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) can be safely conducted.\n\n**Radiotherapy Recommendations**\n\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms tumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or metastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radiotherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based on the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and prior COG\u2013NWTS trials (TABLE 4, 5). The boost dose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III intermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA protocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data in which no locoregional control or survival benefit was observed (Davila Fajardo et al., unpublished data, manuscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung irradiation was decreased from 15 Gy to 12 Gy in the UMBRELLA protocol, to align with previous NWTS experience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall survival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-histology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs.\n\nWhole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for intermediate-risk or high-risk histology tumours with major (visible on imaging or during surgery) preoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or macroscopic peritoneal deposits.\n\nPulmonary radiotherapy is administered for lung metastases lacking a complete response by postoperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority of patients achieving a complete response after induction chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need radiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival even without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS 92%). Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-risk histology, both of which are associated with poor survival of <40%, are the exception and receive radiotherapy to the lungs. Given the inferior outcome with second-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence in the lung, whole-lung irradiation is recommended for patients who did not receive lung irradiation during first-line treatment, irrespective of histology.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults and children with Wilms tumours, with the exception of stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paediatric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II Wilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not performed. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in UMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes and intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of radiotherapy be discussed.\n\nThe UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed description of the radiotherapy target volumes so that advanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if they are available. The potential role of proton therapy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours has only been suggested in a dosimetric study and needs further investigation before implementation in the UMBRELLA protocol.\n\n**Table 5 | Radiotherapy Guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for Metastatic Disease**\n\n| Disease Risk      | Lung (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Liver (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Brain (whole \u00b1 boost) (total/fraction dose) | Bone (total/fraction dose) |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Low-risk          | no                                         | no                                           | no                                            | no                          |\n| Intermediate-risk | 12.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10\u201313 Gy)*                 | 14.4/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                  | 30.6/1.8 Gy                |\n| High-risk         | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 15\u201320 Gy)*                 | 19.8/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 16.2/1.8 Gy)*                | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                  | 30.6/1.8 Gy                |\n\n*Boost dose indicated for residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.\n\n**Table 4 | Radiotherapy Guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for Locoregional Disease**\n\n| Stage             | Low-risk (total/fraction dose) | Intermediate-risk (total/fraction dose) | High-risk blastemal-type Wilms tumour (total/fraction dose) | High-risk diffuse anaplasia (total/fraction dose) |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Stage I           | no                              | no                                      | no                                                        | no                                                |\n| Stage II          | no                              | no                                      | no                                                        | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                     |\n| Stage III         | no                              | 14.4/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*           | 25.2/1.8 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                             | 19.5/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)*                     |\n| Stage III (major rupture)\u2021 | no                  | 15.0/1.5 Gy (\u00b1 10.8/1.8 Gy)\u00a7           | no                                                        | no                                                |\n\n*Boost dose indicated for localized residual tumour at the time of radiotherapy only.  \n\u2021Radiotherapy to the whole abdomen.  \n\u00a7Boost only indicated for multiple residual peritoneal deposits (\u00b1 4.5/1.5 Gy).\n\n---\n\nThis enhanced text maintains the original information and structure while correcting errors and improving readability.",

Furthermore, estimates suggest that approximately 300 instances of complex renal tumours in Europe would benefit from multidisciplinary discussion of treatment with clinicians at centres of expertise. Examples include most instances of bilateral Wilms tumours, patients with extensive intravascular tumour thrombus or complicated metastatic sites, and advanced diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumours. Patients with these diseases could benefit from international collaboration to access specialized surgical techniques, cardiothoracic expertise, innovative radiotherapy options, and guidance for phase I/II trials. European initiatives like the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment (ExPO\u2011r\u2011Net) pilot (http://www.expornet.eu/) aim to enhance such collaboration. The EXPO\u2011R\u2011Net is an online consultation platform for which national reference centres have been identified (FIG. 4), and this platform should contribute to the establishment of international tumour boards, funding for coordinators, IT platforms and logistics, and future outreach to low-income countries.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nAs well as providing a useful guideline for routine clinical practice, the UMBRELLA protocol should stimulate international collaboration and research. By standardizing the treatment for all Wilms tumour types, prospectively collected data from a large, homogeneous cohort of patients will be available for future validation of biomarkers, treatment stratification, and therapeutic targets. Moreover, the UMBRELLA protocol can serve as the SIOP\u2013RTSG best-available treatment standard. It will be the backbone for new treatment approaches in future phase I/II and randomized trials, in which collaboration with the COG will continue to be sought. Global collaboration is still necessary for finding effective treatments for the most unfavorable Wilms tumours, such as refractory metastatic, bilateral, and relapsed high-risk disease, and the UMBRELLA protocol will contribute to this aim.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 4 | Centres involved in the European Expert Paediatric Oncology Reference Network for Diagnostics and Treatment.**\n\n1.
