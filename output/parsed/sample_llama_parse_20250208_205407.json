Issues related to minimally\ninvasive or laparoscopic surgery are addressed in the\nUMBRELLA protocol, and although not advocated,\nowing to lack of evidence supporting its safety, these\ntechniques will be acceptable in selected circumstances,\nincluding small, central tumours with a rim of non -\nmalignant renal tissue, which still enable lymph node\nsampling. Minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery\nshould not be done in patients in whom NSS can be\nsafely performed.\n\nRadiotherapy recommendations\nIn SIOP\u22122001, around 25% of children with Wilms\ntumours underwent radiotherapy to the flank and/or\nmetastatic sites. For the UMBRELLA protocol, the radio-\ntherapy guidelines used in SIOP\u22122001 were refined based\non the experience from a 2017 SIOP\u22122001 analysis and\nprior COG\u2013NWTS trials2,8,14,55(TABLE\u00a04,5). The boost\ndose to the area of lymph node involvement for stage III\nintermediate-risk tumours is omitted in the UMBRELLA\nprotocol, based on a 2017 analysis of SIOP\u22122001 data\nin which no locoregional control or survival benefit was\nobserved (Davila Fajardo et\u00a0al. unpublished data, manu-\nscript submitted). Moreover, the dosage of whole-lung\nirradiation was decreased from 15  Gy to 12 Gy in the\nUMBRELLA protocol, to be in line with previous NWTS\nexperience demonstrating high relapse-free and overall\nsurvival (72% and 78% respectively) for favourable-\nhistology tumours after treatment with doxorubicin,\nactinomycin-D, vincristine, and 12 Gy to the lungs13.\n               Whole-abdominal radiotherapy is indicated for\nintermediate- risk or high-risk histology tumours\nwith major (visible on imaging or during surgery)\npreoperative or intraoperative tumour rupture, or\nmacro scopic peritoneal deposits.\n               Pulmonary radiotherapy is administered for\nlung metastases lacking complete response by post-\noperative week 10. Evidence suggests that the majority\nof patients achieving a complete response after induc -\ntion chemotherapy with or without surgery do not need\nradiotherapy to the lungs, as they have excellent survival\neven without radiotherapy (5-year EFS 84%, 5-year OS\n92%)21. Patients with viable metastases at surgery or high-\nrisk histology, both of which are asso  ciated with poor\nsurvival of <40%, are the exception and receive radio -\ntherapy to the lungs23. Given the inferior outcome with\nsecond-line treatment for patients with disease recurrence\nin the lung, whole-lung ir  radiation is recommended for\npatients who did not receive lung irradiation during\nfirst-line treatment, irrespective of histology56.\n               Radiotherapy recommendations are similar for adults\n\nof stage II disease. In adult protocols, unlike paedi-\natric protocols, radiotherapy is indicated for all stage II\nWilms tumours, as lymph node sampling is often not\nperformed46. Only for adult patients that are enrolled in\nUMBRELLA in time to confirm negative lymph nodes\nand intermediate-risk histology can the avoidance of\nradiotherapy be discussed.\n               The UMBRELLA protocol also provides a detailed\ndescription of the radiotherapy target volumes so that\nadvanced radiotherapy techniques can be applied if\nthey are available. The potential role of proton ther-\napy for flank irradiation in treating Wilms tumours\nhas only been suggested in a dosimetric study, and\nneeds further investigation before implementation in\nthe UMBRELLA protocol57.\n\n                                                             Table 4| Radiotherapy guidelines in UMBRELLA SIOP\u2013RTSG 2016 for locoregional disease\n
